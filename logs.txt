RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I need to prioritize moving blocks to the correct positions and stacking them correctly. I also noticed that the goal state has block e on top of block a, which means I need to move block e to the table first.

Think: My current goal is to move block e to the table. I can achieve this by picking up block e and then putting it down on the table. After that, I can focus on stacking blocks a, g, f, and b in the correct order.

Action: pick-up(e)

Reflect: I learned that I cannot pick up block e, which means I need to focus on unstacking or picking up other blocks. I also noticed that block d is on top of block g, which might be a good starting point to make progress.

Think: My current goal is to unstack block d from block g. This will give me a chance to pick up block d and then stack it correctly. After unstacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Reflect: I learned that I successfully unstacked block h from block e and picked it up. Now I need to decide what to do with block h. I noticed that block e is clear, which means I can stack block h on top of block e.

Think: My current goal is to stack block h on top of block e. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: stack(h,e)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully stacked block d on top of block a. Now I need to focus on unstacking and re-stacking blocks to achieve the goal state. I noticed that block a is on top of block d, which means I need to unstack block a from block d to make progress.

Think: My current goal is to unstack block a from block d. This will give me a chance to pick up block a and then stack it correctly. After unstacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: unstack(a,d)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully unstacked block h from block e and picked it up. Now I need to decide what to do with block h. I noticed that block e is clear, which means I can stack block h on top of block e.

Think: My current goal is to stack block h on top of block e. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully unstacked block d from block a and picked it up. Now I need to decide what to do with block d. I noticed that block a is clear, which means I can stack block d on top of block a.

Think: My current goal is to stack block d on top of block a. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: stack(d,a)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully stacked block d on top of block a. Now I need to focus on unstacking and re-stacking blocks to achieve the goal state. I noticed that block a is on top of block d, which means I need to unstack block a from block d to make progress.

Think: My current goal is to unstack block a from block d. This will give me a chance to pick up block a and then stack it correctly. After unstacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: unstack(a,d)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully unstacked block h from block e and picked it up. Now I need to decide what to do with block h. I noticed that block e is clear, which means I can stack block h on top of block e.

Think: My current goal is to stack block h on top of block e. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: stack(h,e)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully stacked block h on top of block e. Now I need to focus on unstacking and re-stacking blocks to achieve the goal state. I noticed that block g is on top of block b, which means I need to unstack block g from block b to make progress.

Think: My current goal is to unstack block g from block b. This will give me a chance to pick up block g and then stack it correctly. After unstacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: unstack(g,b)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I previously stacked block g on top of block b, but it seems that I made a mistake and block g is not in the correct position. Now I need to focus on unstacking and re-stacking blocks to achieve the goal state. I noticed that block h is on top of block e, which means I need to unstack block h from block e to make progress.

Think: My current goal is to unstack block h from block e. This will give me a chance to pick up block h and then stack it correctly. After unstacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: unstack(h,e)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully unstacked block h from block e and picked it up. Now I need to decide what to do with block h. I noticed that block e is clear, which means I can stack block h on top of block e.

Think: My current goal is to stack block h on top of block e. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: stack(h,e)

Reflect: I learned that I previously stacked block h on top of block e, but it seems that I made a mistake and block h is not in the correct position. Now I need to focus on unstacking and re-stacking blocks to achieve the goal state. I noticed that block g is on top of block b, which means I need to unstack block g from block b to make progress.

Think: My current goal is to unstack block g from block b. This will give me a chance to pick up block g and then stack it correctly. After unstacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully unstacked block g from block b and picked it up. Now I need to decide what to do with block g. I noticed that block a is on the table, which means I can stack block g on top of block a.

Think: My current goal is to stack block g on top of block a. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: stack(g,a)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I cannot stack block g on top of block a, which means I need to choose a different action. I noticed that block b is clear, which means I can stack block g on top of block b.

Think: My current goal is to stack block g on top of block b. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: stack(g,b)

RESPONSE
Reflect: I learned that I successfully unstacked block d from block a and picked it up. Now I need to decide what to do with block d. I noticed that block a is clear, which means I can stack block d on top of block a.

Think: My current goal is to stack block d on top of block a. This will help me make progress towards the goal state. After stacking, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide what to do next.

Action: stack(d,a)
