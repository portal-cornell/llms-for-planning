ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup for the Blocksworld domain, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The robot's hand is currently empty. The configuration of blocks is as follows:
- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is placed on top of block c, and block b is clear.
- Block c is directly on top of block a.
- Block d is on the table and clear. 

This setup indicates that blocks a and d are at the base level on the table, while blocks b and c are stacked with b being at the top of the stack formed with c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the feedback and the valid actions listed, the actions must adhere strictly to the current state dynamics, respecting which blocks are clear and accessible for manipulation.

Think: The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that A is on B, B is on D, and D is on C. Starting with the current state, the robot's hand is empty, and the only valid actions are to pick up block d or unstack block b from c. Since block d needs to ultimately be under block B, picking up block d doesn't immediately help in achieving the goal configuration. However, unstacking block b from c is a preparatory move that will allow for future reorganization of the blocks to align with the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld scenario, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the state of each block:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of it, and it is on top of block a.
- Block b is held by the robot's hand.
- Block d is clear and also on the table.

This setup implies that blocks a and d are positioned directly on the table, block c is stacked on block a, and the robot is currently holding block b, ready for further action.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has changed, and now the robot is holding block b. The available actions align with the block b's status and the clear status of blocks c and d. This needs to be considered to approach the goal configuration efficiently.

Think: To reach the goal state where A is on B, B is on D, and D is on C, it is essential to think about the placement of blocks in a way that allows subsequent moves to follow. Since block b should be on block d according to the goal, and both blocks d and c are clear, placing b on d now aligns with the intended final configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The current configuration is as follows: 
- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is placed on top of block a and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of c.
- Block d is also on the table.
- Block b is on top of block d and is clear.
The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, block b has been successfully placed on block d, which is a step towards the goal state. However, the ultimate goal requires block d to be on top of block c, and not the other way around as currently positioned.

Think: To reorganize the blocks to meet the goal, block d needs to be clear to be moved on top of block c. Currently, block b is on top of d, so it must be moved first. The valid action to unstack block b from block d will clear block d for future repositioning, aligning it to be moved above block c in subsequent moves.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld scenario, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the state of each block:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of it, and it is on top of block a.
- Block b is held by the robot's hand.
- Block d is clear and also on the table.

This setup implies that blocks a and d are positioned directly on the table, block c is stacked on block a, and the robot is currently holding block b, ready for further action.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block b again, which offers a strategic advantage as it can directly stack b onto another block. The previous action successfully cleared block d, preparing it for further rearrangement to align with the goal state.

Think: Given the goal to stack block d on top of block c, and ultimately have block b on block d, it is essential to use block b effectively while it's in the robot's hand. Since block d is clear and on the table, and stacking b on d aligns with the goal configuration, it's advantageous to stack b on d again. This prepares for the final rearrangement where d can be moved on top of c.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The current configuration is as follows: 
- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is placed on top of block a and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of c.
- Block d is also on the table.
- Block b is on top of block d and is clear.
The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot successfully placed block b on top of block d again. Now, to reach the goal state, the next critical move is to rearrange block d to be on top of block c, as block c is currently on top of block a and needs to be cleared.

Think: The valid actions allow for unstacking block c from block a, which is necessary for later moves where block d must be placed on block c. By unstacking block c, it becomes possible to reposition block d accordingly in subsequent steps. Since achieving the goal state requires block d to be clear for stacking on block c, unstacking block c now is a strategic move to facilitate this future placement.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's a detailed breakdown of their configuration:

- Block A is clear and located on the table.
- Block B is clear and is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block C is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block D is on the table but has Block B on top of it.

This setup indicates that Block A and Block D are directly on the table, Block B is elevated on Block D, and the robot is actively holding Block C. Clear blocks are those like A and B, which have no other blocks stacked on them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The situation has progressed towards the goal, with block C now in the robot's hand and blocks B and D partially arranged. The next steps should carefully consider the final arrangement required to achieve the goal state.

Think: The goal state requires block D to be on top of block C. Currently, block D is under block B and cannot be moved until block B is repositioned. However, the robot is holding block C, and the valid actions suggest possible placements for C. Placing block C on the table allows for further flexibility in future moves without committing to a stack that might complicate reaching the goal. This sets up the opportunity to rearrange blocks B and D accordingly after.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D and it is also clear.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration is close to the goal, with the primary challenge being the placement of block D on top of block C. The robot's hand is empty, providing the opportunity to manipulate the blocks further to achieve the desired configuration.

Think: To align with the goal state, where block D must be on top of block C, block B needs to be temporarily moved to allow repositioning of block D. Since block B is currently on top of block D and it needs to ultimately be on top of block D in the goal state, the best immediate action is to unstack block B from block D. This will free up block D to be moved or manipulated in the subsequent steps, specifically to be placed on block C.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table. Block B is being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot has successfully unstacked block B from block D and is now holding it. The next steps should be aligned with the goal state, which requires stacking blocks in a specific order, particularly with block D on top of block C.

Think: The current valid actions allow the robot to stack block B on any of the other blocks or put it down. To progress towards the goal state, block B should ultimately be above block D, and block D needs to be on top of block C. Since block D is directly accessible and must be below block B, placing block B directly on block D is the most strategic move at this point. This will set up the final arrangement where block D can then be placed on block C in a subsequent move.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D and it is also clear.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration of blocks is close to the goal state, but not yet correctly aligned. The robot needs to rearrange block D to be on top of block C as required by the goal.

Think: Since block D is beneath block B and needs to be placed on top of block C, the robot should first gain control of block D. To achieve this, block B must be temporarily removed from block D. The valid action to unstack block B from block D is available and aligns with this need, allowing block D to become accessible for subsequent repositioning.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table. Block B is being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block B, and the configuration allows for strategic placement since blocks A, C, and D are all clear. To progress towards the goal state, it's essential to consider the final required placement of blocks.

Think: The goal state requires block D to be on top of block C. With block B in hand and considering the final arrangement, stacking block B on block D right now will facilitate placing block D on block C afterward. This alignment prepares for the next step in the sequence to achieve the goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D and it is also clear.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block B is positioned on top of Block D as required for the goal, but Block D needs to be on top of Block C. Therefore, the next steps need to address the placement of Block D.

Think: To align with the goal state, Block D, currently under Block B, should be placed on top of Block C. To achieve this, the robot must first gain control of Block C, as Block D cannot be moved while supporting Block B. By picking up Block C, the robot can then be ready to reposition it or prepare for subsequent manipulations that would allow Block D to be placed on it.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's a detailed breakdown of their configuration:

- Block A is clear and located on the table.
- Block B is clear and is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block C is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block D is on the table but has Block B on top of it.

This setup indicates that Block A and Block D are directly on the table, Block B is elevated on Block D, and the robot is actively holding Block C. Clear blocks are those like A and B, which have no other blocks stacked on them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is now holding Block C, and the current configuration of other blocks is close to the goal state, but requires precise manipulation, particularly the placement of Block D on top of Block C.

Think: Given the goal of having Block D on top of Block C, and with Block C currently in the robot's hand, the next logical step is to place Block C directly under Block D. Currently, Block D is occupied with Block B on top, so placing Block C on the table will set up the environment for the next move where Block D can be moved on top of Block C.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D and it is also clear.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty and the blocks are positioned in a way that is close to the goal, but still requires the correct stacking order. Block D needs to be placed on Block C, which is clear and ready.

Think: To eventually stack Block D on Block C, Block B needs to be temporarily removed from Block D. This will make Block D movable. The valid action of unstacking Block B from Block D is appropriate here, as it will free up Block D to be repositioned according to the goal state requirements.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table. Block B is being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block B, and blocks A, C, and D are positioned on the table and clear. The goal configuration requires block D to be stacked on top of block C, then block B on block D, and finally block A on block B.

Think: Since block D needs to be positioned on block C to align with the goal state, and block B is already in the robot's hand, the appropriate action is to stack block B on block D. This allows for subsequent manipulation where block D, once block B is stacked on it, can be moved to stack on block C.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D and it is also clear.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that Block B is already stacked on Block D, which aligns partially with the goal state. However, to fully achieve the goal state, Block D needs to be placed on top of Block C.

Think: The next step towards the goal configuration is to manipulate Block D such that it can be placed onto Block C. Currently, Block D is occupied with Block B. To make Block D available for movement, Block B needs to be temporarily moved. The valid action to unstack Block B from Block D is available, which is the necessary step to free up Block D.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table. Block B is being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block B is currently held by the robot, and the blocks A, C, and D are clear and on the table. The goal is to achieve a specific stacking order where block D is on top of block C, followed by block B on block D, then block A on block B.

Think: Given the goal state requirements and the current state of the blocks, the most strategic move is to place block B on block D. This aligns with part of the goal configuration (block B on top of block D). Also, this move positions block D in a way that it can subsequently be placed on top of block C, which is also a requirement for reaching the goal state.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D and it is also clear.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block B is already correctly stacked on top of Block D, aligning with part of the goal state. However, to fully achieve the goal configuration, Block D needs to be positioned on top of Block C.

Think: Since the robot hand is empty and the goal involves placing Block D on top of Block C, the next strategic move is to manipulate Block C. By picking up Block C, the robot will be prepared to place Block D onto Block C in subsequent actions, thus moving closer to the final goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's a detailed breakdown of their configuration:

- Block A is clear and located on the table.
- Block B is clear and is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block C is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block D is on the table but has Block B on top of it.

This setup indicates that Block A and Block D are directly on the table, Block B is elevated on Block D, and the robot is actively holding Block C. Clear blocks are those like A and B, which have no other blocks stacked on them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding Block C and needs to position it according to the goal state, where Block D, currently supporting Block B, should be placed on top of Block C. The goal configuration requires careful placement of Block C to ensure that Block D can be correctly positioned later.

Think: Since the goal is to have Block D on top of Block C, and Block D is currently inaccessible due to having Block B on top, the next logical step is to place Block C on the table. This action will make Block C available to have Block D placed on it after moving Block B. Placing Block C on the table is a foundational move that sets up the subsequent necessary steps to achieve the goal configuration.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D and it is also clear.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block B is stacked on Block D, but the goal requires Block D to be placed on Block C. The robot hand is currently empty, providing an opportunity to manipulate the blocks to achieve the goal configuration.

Think: To move forward with the goal, where Block D needs to be on top of Block C, it is essential to first free Block D from its current position under Block B. This will enable Block D to be moved onto Block C next. The action to unstack Block B from Block D is available and necessary to make Block D movable.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table. Block B is being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires careful stacking to achieve the desired order from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block B, and the other blocks (A, C, D) are clear on the table. The goal is to have block D on top of block C, followed by block B on block D, and finally block A on block B.

Think: Block D needs to be positioned on top of block C to align with the goal state. Currently, block D is clear and can be moved freely. The best strategy is to place block B on block D, which aligns with the goal and sets up the correct configuration for later placing block D on block C.
