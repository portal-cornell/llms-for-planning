ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects, namely blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current state of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is clear and is placed on top of Block B.
- Block B is located directly on the table.
- Block C is also on the table, with Block D on top of it.
- Block D is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms the basis for any actions the robot may take to rearrange the blocks according to specific goals using the actions available like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The available actions suggest that the only blocks currently involved in interactions where one is directly on top of another and can be unstacked are A on B and D on C. Considering the goal, I need to unstack these blocks to rearrange them into the desired configuration.

Think: To begin reordering the blocks as per the goal state, I need to clear the blocks to make them available for stacking as required. Starting by unstacking D from C is logical as it aligns with the goal configuration and will make C available to receive other blocks on top. Since the robot hand is empty, this action is feasible.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration and state of these objects:

1. Block A is on top of Block B and Block A is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
2. Block B is on the table.
3. Block C is also on the table and is clear.
4. The robot is currently holding Block D.

This setup forms the basis for actions that might involve moving these blocks to achieve a certain configuration, using the actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block D, and the goal requires D to be stacked on top of A. The valid actions include the possibility to stack D directly on A, which aligns perfectly with the required configuration of the goal state.

Think: Since the goal is to have D on A, and this action is directly available, it makes sense to execute it now. This will place D in its correct position according to the goal state and free up the robot's hand for further reconfigurations of the other blocks.

Action: stack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and a robot hand involved in manipulating these blocks. Here's the current state of the environment:

1. Block a is on top of block b.
2. Block d is on top of block a.
3. Both blocks b and c are on the table.
4. Blocks c and d are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms part of a Blocksworld scenario where the robot can perform actions to rearrange the blocks according to specific goals using the operations of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of the blocks is not aligned with the goal state. Notably, D needs to be unstacked from A for further reordering. The robot hand is empty, which allows for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: Since the goal state requires D to be directly on top of A, and currently D is already on A, unstacking D might seem counterintuitive. However, the structure needs to be rearranged correctly to achieve the final goal state configuration. Unstacking D from A will allow for the subsequent placement of C and B as required by the goal state. The available action to unstack D from A should be utilized now to progress towards the goal state layout.

Action: unstack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration and state of these objects:

1. Block A is on top of Block B and Block A is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
2. Block B is on the table.
3. Block C is also on the table and is clear.
4. The robot is currently holding Block D.

This setup forms the basis for actions that might involve moving these blocks to achieve a certain configuration, using the actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block D, and the goal configuration requires D to be directly placed on top of A. Given this alignment with the goal and the availability of the action to stack D on A, this is an opportune moment to execute this action.

Think: Placing D directly on A will align with the goal state's requirement for D to be on A. Since this action is explicitly available and matches our strategic arrangement towards achieving the goal, it is the most efficient move to make at this point.

Action: stack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and a robot hand involved in manipulating these blocks. Here's the current state of the environment:

1. Block a is on top of block b.
2. Block d is on top of block a.
3. Both blocks b and c are on the table.
4. Blocks c and d are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms part of a Blocksworld scenario where the robot can perform actions to rearrange the blocks according to specific goals using the operations of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal configuration necessitates a specific stacking order with B on top of C, C on top of D, and D on top of A. Currently, D is on top of A, which actually aligns with one part of the goal state. However, to continue building the desired structure, adjustments are needed.

Think: Since D is already correctly placed on top of A for the goal, the next logical step is to prepare C for stacking. The action to pick up C is available and aligns with the goal of eventually stacking B on C after C is placed on D. Picking up C will make it ready to be positioned in the sequence as needed.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With Block C in the robot hand, the strategic placement of C according to the goal state needs to be considered. The goal configuration requires C to be directly on top of D, which is currently on top of A. This setup is part of achieving the final goal state configuration.

Think: Since the goal is to stack C on D and D is already correctly positioned on A, the best move is to use the available action to stack C directly onto D. This action directly progresses towards the goal state arrangement without any unnecessary steps.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a description of their current arrangement and status:

1. Block A is on top of Block B.
2. Block D is on top of Block A.
3. Block C is on top of Block D.
4. Block B is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates a stack of blocks with C at the top, followed by D, A, and B at the base, which is on the table. All blocks except for the bottom one (Block B) have another block on them, and the robot's hand is free to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that the blocks are almost in the desired order for the goal state, but they are upside down. Block C, which should be in the middle of the stack according to the goal, is currently at the top. The immediate required action is to rearrange the blocks to match the goal sequence.

Think: To move towards the goal state, the first action should involve making adjustments to the stack to allow for correct repositioning. The available action to unstack C from D is a strategic move since it aligns with the necessity of repositioning C. Removing C will allow further actions to re-stack it correctly as per the goal.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block C, and the goal state requires C to be stacked on top of D. Given this setup, the desired configuration aligns directly with the valid action available to stack C on D.

Think: Since D is already correctly positioned on top of A, and C needs to be above D to meet the goal state requirements, the logical next step is to stack C on D. This action is directly supported by the available valid actions and moves us closer to achieving the desired goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a description of their current arrangement and status:

1. Block A is on top of Block B.
2. Block D is on top of Block A.
3. Block C is on top of Block D.
4. Block B is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates a stack of blocks with C at the top, followed by D, A, and B at the base, which is on the table. All blocks except for the bottom one (Block B) have another block on them, and the robot's hand is free to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of blocks is almost the inverse of the goal state, with C at the top instead of second from the top as required. The robot hand is empty, allowing for manipulation of the blocks. The valid action available, unstacking C from D, is a necessary step towards rearranging the blocks into the correct order as per the goal state.

Think: To align the blocks with the goal state, it is essential to rearrange C to be below B and above D. The action to unstack C from D will make both C and D available for repositioning. Given that D is already correctly placed on top of A, separating C from D will facilitate the eventual restacking needed to achieve the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current situation involves the robot holding Block C, which needs to be positioned above Block D according to the goal state. This is crucial because Block D is already correctly placed on top of Block A, aligning with part of the goal structure. The current valid actions support the next step in achieving this configuration.

Think: The action to stack Block C on top of Block D directly contributes to setting up the correct order as per the goal state, with C above D and D above A. Since this action perfectly aligns with the goal requirements and the robot is holding C, it is the most straightforward and effective move to make.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a description of their current arrangement and status:

1. Block A is on top of Block B.
2. Block D is on top of Block A.
3. Block C is on top of Block D.
4. Block B is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates a stack of blocks with C at the top, followed by D, A, and B at the base, which is on the table. All blocks except for the bottom one (Block B) have another block on them, and the robot's hand is free to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of the blocks has C at the very top of the stack, which does not align with the goal state where C should be between B and D. The action to unstack C from D is valid and necessary to rearrange the blocks correctly according to the goal state.

Think: By unstacking C from D, we can create an opportunity to rearrange C and subsequently position it according to the goal state requirements. Unstacking will place C in the robot's hand, making it ready for further manipulation to achieve the correct stacking order.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block C, and the goal state requires C to be stacked on top of D, which is already correctly positioned on top of A. This forms part of the desired final configuration.

Think: Given that D is in the correct position according to the goal state, and the robot is holding C, the best move is to use the valid action that directly contributes to achieving the goal. Stacking C on D will correctly position it according to the goal state and further the progress towards the final desired arrangement of blocks.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a description of their current arrangement and status:

1. Block A is on top of Block B.
2. Block D is on top of Block A.
3. Block C is on top of Block D.
4. Block B is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates a stack of blocks with C at the top, followed by D, A, and B at the base, which is on the table. All blocks except for the bottom one (Block B) have another block on them, and the robot's hand is free to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of the blocks shows C at the top of a stack that includes D, A, and B, which is not aligned with the goal state requirements. The goal state requires a specific order with B on top of C, C on top of D, and D on top of A. The valid action to unstack C from D is a necessary step to rearrange the blocks correctly according to the goal state.

Think: By unstacking C from D, we can prepare to reposition C appropriately in the stack. Since the robot hand is empty, this unstacking action will allow the robot to hold C, making it ready for further reorganization in subsequent steps to achieve the desired goal state structure.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot is holding Block C, and the goal state requires C to be stacked on top of D, which is already correctly positioned on top of A. The valid actions include the option to stack C on D, which aligns perfectly with the steps needed to achieve the goal state.

Think: Since D is already correctly placed on A according to the goal, and C is to be stacked on D, the action to stack C on D is the most straightforward and effective move towards achieving the desired configuration. This action will place C in its correct position, allowing for the subsequent placement of B on C to complete the goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a description of their current arrangement and status:

1. Block A is on top of Block B.
2. Block D is on top of Block A.
3. Block C is on top of Block D.
4. Block B is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates a stack of blocks with C at the top, followed by D, A, and B at the base, which is on the table. All blocks except for the bottom one (Block B) have another block on them, and the robot's hand is free to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration presents a challenge as it is in direct contradiction to the goal state's requirements. C is currently at the top of the stack but needs to be placed between B and D according to the goal. The valid action to unstack C from D is essential for repositioning it correctly in relation to the other blocks.

Think: By unstacking C from D, the stack will be broken down in a way that allows for subsequent reordering. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal configuration, as it will make both C and D free for rearrangement. Since the robot hand is empty, it is an appropriate time to perform this action.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block C, and the goal state requires C to be directly on top of D, which is currently on top of A. This configuration aligns with the goal state where D should be positioned on top of A, and then C on top of D.

Think: Given that D is already correctly positioned on A, the logical next step is to stack C on D to progress towards the desired goal configuration. This action is directly supported by the valid actions list and strategically moves the arrangement closer to the goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a description of their current arrangement and status:

1. Block A is on top of Block B.
2. Block D is on top of Block A.
3. Block C is on top of Block D.
4. Block B is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates a stack of blocks with C at the top, followed by D, A, and B at the base, which is on the table. All blocks except for the bottom one (Block B) have another block on them, and the robot's hand is free to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows a vertical stack of blocks with C at the top, followed by D, A, and B at the base. This arrangement does not align with the goal state, which requires B on top of C, C on top of D, and D on top of A. The robot hand is empty, which provides an opportunity to manipulate the blocks as needed.

Think: To begin aligning the blocks with the goal state, it is necessary to rearrange them so that C can eventually be placed between B and D. The valid action to unstack C from D is a critical step towards achieving this configuration. By unstacking C, it allows for subsequent repositioning of C and D to more closely match the goal state layout.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot currently holds Block C, and the goal state dictates that C needs to be placed on top of D, which is already correctly positioned on top of A. This is a crucial step to align with the goal configuration.

Think: Since D is in the right position above A and the robot hand holds C, the action to stack C on D directly contributes to achieving the goal state. This action is available and aligns perfectly with the steps required to arrange the blocks as specified in the goal.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has C at the top of the stack, which does not align with the goal state where C needs to be between B and D. The robot's hand being empty is advantageous for manipulating the blocks.

Think: Unstacking C from D is a necessary step to rearrange the stack to match the goal state. This action will place C in the robot's hand, allowing for the subsequent repositioning of C between B and D as required by the goal. It is a strategic move to begin reorganizing the stack in accordance with the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is located on top of block b.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific vertical order on a table. Specifically, the block labeled 'b' should be placed on top of block 'c', block 'c' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'd' should be positioned on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked sequentially from 'a' at the bottom to 'b' at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block C, which aligns with the next steps needed to achieve the goal state, as C needs to be positioned above D. D is already appropriately placed on top of A, completing a part of the goal configuration.

Think: The direct action to stack C on D is available and aligns perfectly with the goal requirements. This move will correctly position C over D, which is a crucial step towards setting up the correct order from A at the bottom to B at the top.
