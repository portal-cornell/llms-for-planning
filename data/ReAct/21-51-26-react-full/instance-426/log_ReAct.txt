ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration of these objects:

- Block c is on top of block b.
- Block a is on top of block d.
- Blocks b and d are directly on the table.
- Blocks a and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup represents the initial state of the blocks and their arrangement relative to each other and the table.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block A. To achieve this specific configuration, the robot hand will need to manipulate the blocks accordingly, ensuring that A is on D and then C is stacked on A.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot hand is empty, it is essential to pick up or unstack a block before any further actions such as stacking or putting down can be executed. The error feedback mechanism will be helpful for ensuring that only valid actions are attempted.

Think: The goal is to have block C on block A, which is on block D. The current configuration has block A already on block D, which is a part of the desired final state. To achieve the goal configuration, block C must be moved. Since block C is currently on block B and is clear, and the valid action to unstack C from B is available, this should be the next move. This will make block C available to be stacked later.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows: 
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'd'.
- Blocks 'b' and 'd' are both placed directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'c'.
- Both blocks 'a' and 'b' are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block A. To achieve this specific configuration, the robot hand will need to manipulate the blocks accordingly, ensuring that A is on D and then C is stacked on A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'c', which is intended to be placed on block 'a' according to the goal state. The available actions include putting down block 'c' or stacking it on either block 'a' or block 'b'. It is important to choose the action that directly contributes to achieving the goal.

Think: The goal requires block 'c' to be stacked on block 'a', which is already correctly positioned on block 'd'. Since block 'a' is clear and the action to stack 'c' on 'a' is available, this action will directly progress towards the goal state without any redundant steps.
