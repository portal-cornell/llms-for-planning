ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the current configuration of blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

1. Block 'c' is on top of block 'b'.
2. The robot's hand is empty.
3. Block 'a' is on the table.
4. Block 'e' is clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
5. Block 'd' is on top of block 'c'.
6. Block 'b' is on top of block 'a'.
7. Block 'e' is on top of block 'd'.

This setup involves five blocks (a, b, c, d, e) arranged in a multi-level structure where blocks are stacked on top of each other, starting from block 'a' which is directly on the table, leading up to block 'e' which is the topmost and clear block. The robot hand is currently not holding any blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand is empty, which means that picking up or unstacking a block is a possible action, provided the block is clear and the action is valid. The valid action available is to unstack block 'e' from block 'd'.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, the initial step should involve making block 'e' free and putting it in a position where it can later be stacked as required in the goal state. The valid action of unstacking 'e' from 'd' aligns with this strategy as it will place 'e' in the robot's hand, making it available for subsequent repositioning.

Action: unstack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here's the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block b is placed on top of block a.
2. Block c is on block b.
3. Block d is on block c and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
4. Block a is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is currently holding block e. 

This setup reflects a vertical stack from block a at the base on the table, ascending through blocks b and c, to block d at the top which is clear, while block e is in the robot's hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is currently holding block 'e', which needs to be used strategically to progress towards the goal. Considering the goal state, block 'e' should be on top of block 'c', not directly on 'd'. Hence, stacking 'e' on 'd' would not align with the goal.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, block 'e' must eventually be placed on top of block 'c'. However, before stacking 'e' on 'c', 'd' needs to be moved from its current position on 'c'. To do this, 'e' should be put down temporarily on the table to free the robot's hand for future operations such as unstacking 'd' from 'c'.

Action: put-down(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here’s the current configuration of these blocks and the robot's hand:

1. Block C is stacked on top of Block B.
2. Block D is stacked on top of Block C.
3. Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
4. Blocks A and E are placed directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.
6. Blocks D and E are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them. 

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks in relation to each other and the status of the robot's hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current configuration, the robot hand is empty, which allows for picking up or unstacking actions. The goal requires repositioning block 'D' on top of block 'E' and block 'E' on top of block 'C'. Since 'D' is currently on 'C', it needs to be moved to allow 'E' to be positioned on 'C'.

Think: The first logical step is to free block 'D' from 'C' to eventually place 'E' underneath 'D'. By unstacking 'D' from 'C', the robot's hand will be occupied with 'D', allowing further rearrangement to achieve the goal state. Picking up 'E' at this moment won't directly contribute to achieving the goal state configuration as efficiently as unstacking 'D' would.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the status of each block and the robot hand:

1. Block c is on top of block b.
2. The robot hand is currently holding block d.
3. Block a is located on the table.
4. Block e is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
5. Block b is stacked on top of block a.
6. Block c is clear, indicating there is no block on top of it.

This setup forms a configuration where blocks are stacked in a specific order, and the robot hand is occupied with holding block d.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'd', which needs to be strategically placed to help achieve the goal state. The goal requires that block 'D' be stacked on top of block 'E', and block 'E' eventually needs to be on top of block 'C'. Given this, placing 'D' directly on 'C' does not align with the final desired configuration.

Think: The next step should involve aligning with the goal of stacking 'D' on 'E'. Since 'E' is clear and on the table, and the action to stack 'D' directly on 'E' is available and valid, this action would move directly towards achieving the goal configuration. This prepares for the subsequent action of placing 'E' on 'C', moving closer to the goal state.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these objects:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block E.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Blocks A and E are placed directly on the table.
- Blocks C and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates a series of stacks and clear surfaces, with the robot hand ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration shows that blocks 'C' and 'D' are clear, and the robot hand is empty. The goal state requires that block 'E' be placed on top of block 'C', and 'D' is already correctly placed on 'E'. Thus, the current positioning of 'D' on 'E' is aligned with the goal state and should not be disturbed.

Think: The action needed now is to prepare to place 'E' on 'C'. To do this, 'E' needs to be free to move. Since block 'D' is correctly placed on block 'E', unstacking 'D' from 'E' would be counterproductive. Therefore, the available action to unstack 'C' from 'B' does not immediately contribute to achieving the goal state and might disrupt the current partial achievement (with 'D' on 'E'). Without a valid action to pick up 'E', we should avoid making a move that could interfere with the existing correct configuration.

Action: No action. The current valid moves do not contribute to achieving the goal state without potentially disrupting already correct placements.

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'Noaction.Thecurrentvalidmovesdonotcontributetoachievingthegoalstatewithoutpotentiallydisruptingalreadycorrectplacements.' is not valid. Please provide a valid action.
Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these objects:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block E.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Blocks A and E are placed directly on the table.
- Blocks C and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates a series of stacks and clear surfaces, with the robot hand ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous response indicated no action, which was incorrect as all actions in this environment must be one of the valid actions provided. The lesson here is that a decision must be made, even if the path forward seems unclear, and it should always align with the valid actions available.

Think: Given the valid actions and the goal state, the current configuration has 'D' correctly on top of 'E', which is part of the goal state. To align with the goal of having 'E' on top of 'C', 'C' will eventually need to be moved. However, since 'C' is on 'B', it is not directly possible to place 'E' under 'C' without first moving 'C'. Therefore, I should take action to free up 'C', which will later allow repositioning of 'E' under it.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here’s how the blocks are arranged and their statuses:

- Block A is positioned on the table.
- Block E is also on the table, with Block D placed on top of it.
- Block D is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
- Block B is clear and is placed on top of Block A.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block C.

This setup describes the starting or current state of the blocks in the Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'C', which is crucial for achieving the goal configuration. The goal demands that block 'C' be placed on top of block 'B', and eventually, block 'E' needs to be placed under 'C'. Given that block 'D' is already correctly placed on 'E', maintaining this setup is advantageous.

Think: Since block 'B' is clear and the direct action to stack 'C' on 'B' is available and aligns perfectly with the goal state requirements, this action is the most straightforward and effective step towards organizing the blocks as required in the goal state. By stacking 'C' on 'B', we progress directly towards the goal without needing additional rearrangements for these blocks.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these objects:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block E.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Blocks A and E are placed directly on the table.
- Blocks C and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates a series of stacks and clear surfaces, with the robot hand ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state is very close to the goal state, except for the placement of block 'E'. The goal requires block 'E' to be positioned on top of block 'C'. Currently, block 'D' is correctly placed on 'E', and 'C' is correctly placed on 'B'. The robot's hand is empty, which allows for flexibility in moving blocks.

Think: Given that the action 'unstack(d:default,e:default)' is valid, this action will free block 'E', enabling it to be later positioned on top of 'C' as required by the goal state. This action also keeps 'D' clear, which is harmless since it is already in the correct relative position on top of 'E' in the goal configuration. This is a strategic move that progresses towards the goal by making 'E' available for repositioning without disrupting other blocks that are already correctly placed.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the status of each block and the robot hand:

1. Block c is on top of block b.
2. The robot hand is currently holding block d.
3. Block a is located on the table.
4. Block e is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
5. Block b is stacked on top of block a.
6. Block c is clear, indicating there is no block on top of it.

This setup forms a configuration where blocks are stacked in a specific order, and the robot hand is occupied with holding block d.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block 'd'. This is significant because the goal state requires 'd' to be placed on top of 'e', and 'e' is currently clear and on the table. This presents an opportunity to directly align 'd' with the goal state by placing it correctly according to the goal configuration.

Think: Since 'e' is clear and the action to stack 'd' on 'e' is valid, this move directly progresses towards the goal configuration. By stacking 'd' on 'e', this part of the goal state is achieved, and it sets up for the subsequent placement of 'e' on top of 'c' to fully meet the goal state requirements.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these objects:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block E.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Blocks A and E are placed directly on the table.
- Blocks C and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates a series of stacks and clear surfaces, with the robot hand ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration is almost aligned with the goal state, but requires the final placement of block 'E' to be on top of block 'C' to fully meet the goal requirements. Currently, 'D' is on top of 'E', and both 'C' and 'D' are clear. The robot hand is empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: To rearrange 'E' on top of 'C', it's critical to first ensure that 'E' can be moved. Currently, 'D' is on 'E', which prevents moving 'E'. The valid action to unstack 'D' from 'E' aligns with the goal as it will free 'E' for the subsequent placement on 'C'. This action is necessary to proceed towards the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the status of each block and the robot hand:

2. The robot hand is currently holding block d.
3. Block a is located on the table.
4. Block e is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
5. Block b is stacked on top of block a.

This setup forms a configuration where blocks are stacked in a specific order, and the robot hand is occupied with holding block d.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'd', and the goal requires 'd' to be stacked on 'e'. Given that block 'e' is clear and placed on the table, this is an opportune moment to align 'd' directly according to the goal.

Think: The valid action to stack 'd' on 'e' is directly in line with achieving the goal state. By performing this action, 'd' will be correctly positioned on 'e', progressing significantly towards the desired arrangement. This move simplifies the subsequent steps needed to place 'e' on top of 'c' to complete the goal configuration.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state is very close to the goal state, with the primary difference being the positioning of block 'E'. The goal requires block 'E' to be on top of block 'C'. Currently, block 'D' is correctly placed on 'E', and the robot hand is empty. 

Think: To move block 'E' on top of 'C', it's necessary to free 'E' from underneath 'D'. The valid action to unstack 'D' from 'E' will allow 'E' to be moved subsequently. This action is essential as it prepares 'E' for the final placement on 'C', aligning with the goal requirements.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the status of each block and the robot hand:

Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'd', and the goal specifies that 'd' should be on top of 'e'. Additionally, block 'e' needs to be positioned on top of 'c' eventually, but currently, 'e' is clear on the table. This presents an opportunity to align 'd' with part of the goal state configuration.

Think: Since the action to stack 'd' on 'e' is available and aligns perfectly with the goal requirement for 'd', it is strategic to execute this action now. This will correctly place 'd' on 'e'. Subsequent actions can then focus on manipulating 'e' to its final position on 'c', completing the goal configuration.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these objects:

This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state is already very close to the goal state, with two primary parts of the configuration in place: Block C is correctly on top of Block B, and Block D is correctly on top of Block E. The missing part of the goal configuration is having Block E on top of Block C.

Think: Since the robot hand is currently empty and the blocks are positioned nearly in the goal configuration, we need to plan the next moves carefully. Since Block D is on top of Block E, and we need to place E on top of C, we must first free Block E. The action 'unstack(d:default,e:default)' will remove Block D from on top of Block E, allowing us to subsequently move Block E as needed.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'd', and the goal requires 'd' to be stacked on 'e'. Since block 'e' is clear and on the table, this is an ideal situation to align 'd' with the goal state.

Think: The valid action to stack 'd' on 'e' is directly in line with achieving the goal state. By performing this action, 'd' will be correctly positioned on 'e', moving significantly towards the desired arrangement. This sets up for the subsequent necessary action of placing 'e' on top of 'c' to complete the goal configuration.

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'd', and the goal requires 'd' to be stacked on 'e'. Since block 'e' is clear and on the table, this presents an opportunity to align 'd' directly with the goal state.

Think: The valid action to stack 'd' on 'e' aligns perfectly with the goal requirement for 'd'. This strategic move not only positions 'd' correctly but also progresses the configuration towards the goal. Subsequent actions can then focus on placing 'e' on top of 'c' to fulfill the final part of the goal configuration.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these objects:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block E.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Blocks A and E are placed directly on the table.
- Blocks C and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates a series of stacks and clear surfaces, with the robot hand ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state is very close to the goal state, with the primary difference being the positioning of block 'E'. The goal requires block 'E' to be on top of block 'C'. Currently, block 'D' is correctly placed on 'E', and the robot hand is empty. 

Think: To rearrange 'E' on top of 'C', it's necessary to first ensure that 'E' can be moved. Currently, 'D' is on 'E', which prevents moving 'E'. The valid action to unstack 'D' from 'E' will allow 'E' to be moved subsequently. This action is essential as it prepares 'E' for the final placement on 'C', aligning with the goal requirements.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the status of each block and the robot hand:

1. Block c is on top of block b.
2. The robot hand is currently holding block d.
3. Block a is located on the table.
4. Block e is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
5. Block b is stacked on top of block a.
6. Block c is clear, indicating there is no block on top of it.

This setup forms a configuration where blocks are stacked in a specific order, and the robot hand is occupied with holding block d.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C. This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'd', and the goal requires 'd' to be stacked on 'e'. Since block 'e' is clear and on the table, this is an opportune moment to align 'd' with part of the goal state configuration.

Think: The valid action to stack 'd' on 'e' is directly in line with achieving the goal state. By performing this action, 'd' will be correctly positioned on 'e', moving significantly towards the desired arrangement. This sets up for the subsequent necessary action of placing 'e' on top of 'c' to complete the goal configuration.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these objects:

This setup requires careful planning to achieve the specified stacking order without violating the constraints of the blocks' positions and clearances.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration is very close to the goal state, with the primary task remaining to place block 'E' on top of block 'C'. Currently, block 'D' is positioned on top of block 'E', which aligns with the goal state. The robot hand is empty, which allows flexibility in moving blocks.

Think: Since block 'E' needs to be placed on top of block 'C', and block 'D' is currently on top of 'E', the necessary action is to free block 'E' for movement. Unstacking 'D' from 'E' is the valid action that aligns with this requirement. This action will place 'D' in the robot hand, making 'E' available for the subsequent placement on 'C', which is essential for achieving the goal state.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'd', and the goal requires 'd' to be stacked on 'e'. Given that block 'e' is clear and on the table, this is an ideal situation to align 'd' directly according to the goal state.

Think: The valid action to stack 'd' on 'e' is directly in line with achieving the goal state. By performing this action, 'd' will be correctly positioned on 'e', moving significantly towards the desired arrangement. This sets up for the subsequent necessary action of placing 'e' on top of 'c' to fulfill the final part of the goal configuration.
