ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand are as follows:

- The robot's hand is empty.
- Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block b is stacked on top of block d.
- Block c is on the table and is clear.
- Block d is on the table.
- Block e is stacked on top of block b and is clear.

This setup describes a scenario in the Blocksworld domain where some blocks are stacked on others, some are clear, and some are directly on the table, with the robot hand ready to manipulate the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(e:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the given scenario, the robot's hand is empty which allows for the initial action to be picking up or unstacking a block. 

Think: Since the goal includes having block C on top of block E, and block E on top of block A, the first step should involve making block E available to be placed on block A. Currently, block E is on top of block B, so it can be unstacked.

Action: unstack(e:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the situation with the blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Blocks **a**, **c**, and **d** are on the table.
- Block **b** is on top of block **d**.
- The robot hand is holding block **e**.
- Blocks **a**, **b**, and **c** are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)
- stack(e:default,b:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block e, which aligns well with our goal of placing e on top of a. The options available for action include putting down block e or stacking it on blocks a, b, or c.

Think: To progress towards the goal, block e needs to be placed on top of block a according to the goal state. This action is available and aligns directly with our objectives.

Action: stack(e:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld scenario described, the current state includes five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the summary of the environment and the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table, and block e is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is stacked on top of block d, which is on the table.
- Blocks c is also on the table.
- Blocks b, c, and e are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup provides a clear view of the positions and states of all blocks, crucial for planning movements such as stacking or unstacking using the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows block e already stacked on block a, which is part of the goal state. Therefore, unstacking e from a would be counterproductive. The robot's hand being empty allows for actions such as picking up or unstacking blocks that are clear.

Think: To move towards the goal state where block C needs to be on top of block E, the next logical step is to pick up block C since it is clear and on the table. This would prepare it for placing on top of block E in a subsequent move.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here is the current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block E is on top of Block A.
2. Block A is on the table.
3. Block D is also on the table.
4. Block B is on top of Block D.
5. Blocks B and E are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
6. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.

This setup illustrates the positions and states of each block in relation to one another and the robot hand's status.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block C, and the goal state requires block C to be on top of block E. Block E is already correctly positioned on top of block A.

Think: To align with the goal state, the logical action is to stack block C on top of block E. This move directly contributes to achieving the desired configuration of blocks as specified in the goal state.
