ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within the blocks world environment:

- The robot's hand is empty.
- Blocks "a", "b", and "c" are all placed directly on the table.
- Block "d" is positioned on top of block "c".
- Blocks "a", "b", and "d" are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them, and they can be manipulated.
- The objects present in this environment are blocks "a", "b", "c", and "d".
Goal State:
In this environment, you are working with a set of blocks and a table, assisted by a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A clear block is one that does not have another block on top of it. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This requires achieving a vertical stack where 'c' is the topmost block, followed by 'a', and then 'b' at the bottom. This setup involves using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to reach the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves all blocks being on the table except for block "d", which is on top of block "c". The goal state requires a specific arrangement of blocks 'b', 'a', and 'c'. The robot's hand is empty, which means it can pick up or unstack a clear block.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, block "d" must be moved from its current position on block "c" so that block "c" can eventually be stacked on block "a". Since "d" is clear and the hand is empty, the valid action to begin with should be to unstack "d" from "c".

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D. Blocks A, B, and C are all placed on the table. Each of these blocks (A, B, and C) is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of them.
Goal State:
In this environment, you are working with a set of blocks and a table, assisted by a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A clear block is one that does not have another block on top of it. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This requires achieving a vertical stack where 'c' is the topmost block, followed by 'a', and then 'b' at the bottom. This setup involves using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to reach the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is currently holding block "d", and the goal requires stacking blocks "a", "b", and "c" in specific order without involving block "d" directly. Therefore, block "d" should be placed in a position that does not interfere with the stacking of the other blocks.

Think: Since blocks "a", "b", and "c" need to be clear to achieve the desired stacking for the goal state, and block "d" is not part of this stack, the best action is to put "d" down on the table. This will keep the other blocks clear and ready to be manipulated in subsequent steps.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and all of these blocks are located on the table. Each block (A, B, C, D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks placed on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This set-up allows for actions such as picking up any block since they are all clear and accessible.
Goal State:
In this environment, you are working with a set of blocks and a table, assisted by a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A clear block is one that does not have another block on top of it. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This requires achieving a vertical stack where 'c' is the topmost block, followed by 'a', and then 'b' at the bottom. This setup involves using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to reach the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With all blocks clear and the robot's hand empty, we are in a good position to begin the steps necessary to achieve the configured goal state. Since the goal is to stack 'c' on 'a' and 'a' on 'b', the first logical step involves manipulating block 'b', as it serves as the base for the desired stack.

Think: To initiate the stacking process, block 'b' should remain on the table as it will form the base of the stack. The next step involves placing 'a' on 'b'. To do this, 'a' needs to be picked up so it can later be stacked on 'b'.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The situation is as follows:

- Blocks B, C, and D are on the table.
- Block A is being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. 

This setup represents the starting or current state of the blocks in the Blocksworld domain, with one block in the robot's hand and the others positioned on the table without any blocks stacked on top of them.
Goal State:
In this environment, you are working with a set of blocks and a table, assisted by a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A clear block is one that does not have another block on top of it. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This requires achieving a vertical stack where 'c' is the topmost block, followed by 'a', and then 'b' at the bottom. This setup involves using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to reach the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block "a", which aligns well with the goal of stacking it on block "b" next, as per the goal configuration. The valid actions suggest that it's possible to stack "a" directly on "b", "c", or "d", but for achieving the goal, stacking it on "b" is the required step.

Think: Since "b" is clear and available on the table, and the goal is to place "a" on "b", the direct action to progress towards the goal state would be to stack "a" on "b". This action adheres to the goal of eventually having "c" on top of "a" and "a" on top of "b".

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is positioned on top of Block B and is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Blocks B, C, and D are all on the table.
- Block C is clear.
- Block D is also clear.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks. This setting prepares the scene for operations like moving blocks or rearranging them to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, you are working with a set of blocks and a table, assisted by a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A clear block is one that does not have another block on top of it. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This requires achieving a vertical stack where 'c' is the topmost block, followed by 'a', and then 'b' at the bottom. This setup involves using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to reach the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state is close to the goal state, with block "a" already stacked on block "b". To progress towards the goal state where block "c" needs to be on top of block "a", the robot hand needs to manipulate block "c", which is clear and on the table.

Think: Since block "c" is the next block that needs to be stacked (on top of block "a"), and it is clear and pick-up-able, the logical next step is to pick up block "c". This action will prepare for the subsequent stacking of "c" on "a", moving closer to achieving the goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld scenario, we have four objects labeled as a, b, c, and d. The environment is currently arranged as follows:

- Block a is on top of block b and the top of block a is clear.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block d is also directly on the table and its top is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup describes the positions and status of each block relative to each other and the table, as well as the state of the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, you are working with a set of blocks and a table, assisted by a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A clear block is one that does not have another block on top of it. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This requires achieving a vertical stack where 'c' is the topmost block, followed by 'a', and then 'b' at the bottom. This setup involves using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to reach the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current setup has block "a" already correctly positioned on block "b", aligning well with part of the goal. The robot hand is holding block "c", which needs to be stacked on top of block "a" to achieve the final goal configuration.

Think: Since block "c" is already in the robot's hand and block "a" is clear and positioned correctly on "b", the immediate action to move towards the goal state is to stack "c" on "a". This action will complete the desired stack of 'c' on 'a' on 'b'.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
