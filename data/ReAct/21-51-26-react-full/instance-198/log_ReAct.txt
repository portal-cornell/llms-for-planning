ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, the setup of blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block 'a' is positioned on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'b' is placed on top of block 'c'.
- Both blocks 'c' and 'd' are directly on the table.
- Block 'd' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block 'a' is also clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This scenario involves four objects, all of which are blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration needs to be achieved by the robot using actions like picking up and stacking blocks, or unstacking and putting down blocks to move from the current state to this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The valid actions available indicate that the robot hand can either pick up block 'd' since it's clear and on the table, or unstack block 'a' from block 'b'. It's critical to analyze the goal state and choose actions that progressively build towards that configuration.

Think: In the goal state, we need block 'B' to remain on block 'C', with block 'D' on top of block 'B'. Since block 'a' doesn't interfere with the goal state stacking order and is clear, unstacking it from 'b' will allow us to later manipulate block 'b', which is essential. By moving block 'a' away, we can later move block 'd' to its final position on top of block 'b' more straightforwardly.

Action: unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration and status of each:

- Block B is positioned on top of Block C. 
- The robot hand is currently holding Block A.
- Block D is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it, and it is also placed directly on the table.
- Block C is also directly on the table.
- Block B is clear, indicating there is no block on top of it.

This setup involves blocks being stacked, held, and resting on the table, with some blocks being unobstructed and ready for manipulation.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration needs to be achieved by the robot using actions like picking up and stacking blocks, or unstacking and putting down blocks to move from the current state to this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is currently holding block 'A', and the valid actions suggest that it can either put down block 'A' or stack it on blocks 'B' or 'D'. Given the goal state, where block 'D' should be on top of block 'B', and block 'B' is already on block 'C', we need to avoid placing block 'A' in a position that would complicate reaching the goal.

Think: The optimal move would be to keep block 'A' out of the way by putting it down on the table, making it easier to manipulate block 'D' later. By putting down block 'A', we can then focus on stacking block 'D' on top of block 'B' to achieve the goal state configuration. This action keeps blocks 'B' and 'D' clear for subsequent manipulation without additional complications.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block A is on the table and clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block B is stacked on top of Block C and is also clear. Both Blocks C and D are on the table and clear. This setup indicates that each block is accessible for the robot to perform actions like picking up or stacking.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration needs to be achieved by the robot using actions like picking up and stacking blocks, or unstacking and putting down blocks to move from the current state to this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot's hand is empty, and the valid actions include picking up blocks 'A' and 'D' or unstacking block 'B' from 'C'. Since the goal is to have block 'D' on top of block 'B' which is on 'C', and block 'B' is already correctly on 'C', unstacking 'B' from 'C' would be counterproductive.

Think: To progress towards the goal, the best action is to pick up block 'D' since it is clear and on the table. This prepares us to stack 'D' on 'B', aligning directly with the goal configuration. By focusing on moving 'D' next, we ensure the final arrangement can be completed efficiently, especially since 'B' and 'C' are already in the correct configuration.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Currently, the robot hand is holding block 'd'. Block 'a' is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear. Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'c' and is also clear. Block 'c' is directly on the table. This setup indicates that blocks 'a' and 'c' are accessible for manipulation by the robot, either to be picked up or to have another block stacked upon them.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration needs to be achieved by the robot using actions like picking up and stacking blocks, or unstacking and putting down blocks to move from the current state to this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block 'D', which is significant because the goal state requires block 'D' to be stacked on top of block 'B'. The valid actions include putting down block 'D' or stacking it on top of blocks 'A' or 'B'. 

Think: Given the goal of having block 'D' on top of block 'B', which is already correctly on top of block 'C', the direct approach to achieve this goal is to stack 'D' on 'B'. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state, allowing us to progress efficiently without additional moves or rearrangements.
