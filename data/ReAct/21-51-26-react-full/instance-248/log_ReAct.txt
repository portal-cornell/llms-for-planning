ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a robot hand and four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, all blocks (A, B, C, and D) are placed on the table and each one of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty at the moment. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or moved by the robot hand without needing to unstack them first.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by appropriately using the robot's actions to move the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, all blocks are clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty. Given that the goal state requires stacking blocks in a specific arrangement, the first step is to pick up a block that forms the base of one of the required stacks.

Think: Given the goal state, the base for the tallest stack (B on D) should be arranged first to avoid later rearrangement. Since block D needs to remain on the table to place B on it directly, I should pick up block B to prepare for this stacking.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, which is a version of the classic Blocksworld with a robot and blocks, the situation involves four blocks, labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the summary of the state of the blocks and the robot's hand:

1. Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block C is on the table and is also clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
4. Block D is on the table and clear, meaning no blocks are stacked on top of it.

This setup indicates that the robot's hand is currently occupied with holding Block B, while the other blocks are freely positioned on the table without any obstructions above them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by appropriately using the robot's actions to move the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With block B in the robot's hand, the correct sequence of stacking must be considered to meet the goal state description. The robot can now stack B on another block.

Think: To align with the goal state, block B needs to be on top of block D. Currently, block D is clear and on the table, making it the ideal candidate to stack block B on. This action will set the foundation for achieving the desired configuration as per the goal state.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. The current configurations and conditions of these blocks are as follows:
- Block a is on the table and it is clear.
- Block b is on top of block d and it is clear.
- Block c is on the table and it is clear.
- Block d is on the table.
Additionally, the robot's hand is empty. This setup indicates that all blocks are either directly on the table or stacked in a single arrangement, with b on d, and the robot is ready to manipulate any of the blocks since its hand is not occupied.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by appropriately using the robot's actions to move the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block B is correctly placed on top of block D, aligning with part of the goal state. The robot's hand is empty, which allows for further manipulation of other blocks to achieve the full goal configuration.

Think: The next step towards the goal state involves placing block A on top of block B. Since block A is clear and on the table, the first step is to pick up block A. This will enable us to subsequently stack it as required.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this scenario, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration and status of the blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block c and block b are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
2. The robot hand is holding block a.
3. Blocks c and d are on the table.
4. Block b is on top of block d.

This setup describes the starting or current state of the blocks in relation to each other and the robot's involvement.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by appropriately using the robot's actions to move the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block A, and blocks B and D are already stacked as part of the final goal configuration. The ultimate arrangement requires block A to be on top of block B.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, block A should be stacked on block B, which is already correctly positioned on top of block D. This action would align with the goal configuration, moving closer to completing the desired stack arrangement.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld setup, we have four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Here's how they are arranged and the status of each:

1. Block a is on top of block b and it has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block b is directly on top of block d.
3. Block c is clear and placed directly on the table.
4. Block d is also directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform an action like picking up or moving a block.

This arrangement describes a scenario where the blocks are stacked in a specific order with two blocks on the table, and the robot hand is free to manipulate the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by appropriately using the robot's actions to move the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration of blocks A on B and B on D is already in place, matching part of the goal state requirements. The next objective is to place block C on top of block A.

Think: To complete the goal state configuration, block C needs to be stacked on top of block A. Since block C is clear and on the table and the robot hand is empty, the first necessary action is to pick up block C.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The relationships between these blocks and their positions are as follows:

- Block A is located on top of Block B.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block D is placed directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block C.
- Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

This setup forms a tower of blocks with D at the base, B in the middle, and A at the top, while Block C is in the robot's grip and not part of the tower.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by appropriately using the robot's actions to move the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block C, and the rest of the block arrangement with A on B and B on D matches part of the goal configuration. The final step to achieve the goal state is placing block C on top of block A.

Think: Since block A is already positioned correctly and is clear, and the robot hand is holding block C, the direct and final action to achieve the goal state is to stack block C on top of block A.
