ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Block A is on the table.
3. Block B is on top of Block C and Block B is clear.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block D is on the table and is clear.

This setup reflects the initial state of the environment involving the positions of the blocks relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot hand is currently empty, the initial move should involve picking up a block or unstacking one that is currently on top of another. 

Think: The goal requires the configuration 'a' on 'c' and 'c' on 'b'. However, the current state has 'b' on 'c' and 'c' on 'a', which is not aligned with the goal. To progress towards the goal configuration, it is necessary to remove 'b' from on top of 'c' first, as this will later allow us to rearrange 'c' and then stack 'a' on top of it. The only valid action that directly affects the blocks 'b' or 'c' right now is unstacking 'b' from 'c'.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Here’s the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is positioned on top of block a.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is also on the table.

This setup involves the robot hand actively holding block b, while blocks a and d are directly on the table. Block c, being clear, is stackable, and it currently sits atop block a, which is also clear for further actions if needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, which is an important detail as it limits actions to either putting down block B or stacking it on another block. The goal of stacking 'a' on 'c' and 'c' on 'b' remains unchanged.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, block 'c' needs to be on top of block 'b'. Since the robot hand is holding 'b', and 'c' is clear and accessible, the direct action that aligns with the goal is to stack 'b' on 'c'. This sets the foundation for later arranging 'a' on top of 'c' to meet the goal state.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Block A is on the table.
3. Block B is on top of Block C and Block B is clear.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block D is on the table and is clear.

This setup reflects the initial state of the environment involving the positions of the blocks relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state remains as initially described with an empty robot hand, and the configuration of blocks is unchanged. The goal requires the arrangement of blocks such that 'a' is on 'c' and 'c' on 'b', which is still unmet.

Think: Given the goal configuration, we need to rearrange 'b', 'c', and 'a'. Currently, 'b' is on 'c', which is an incorrect order relative to the goal. The first step should be to clear 'c' by removing 'b'. The action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' is valid and directly contributes to this goal by making 'c' available to be placed below 'a' later.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Here’s the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is positioned on top of block a.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is also on the table.

This setup involves the robot hand actively holding block b, while blocks a and d are directly on the table. Block c, being clear, is stackable, and it currently sits atop block a, which is also clear for further actions if needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal requires block C to be on top of block B. With block C currently on top of block A, it's accessible for stacking.

Think: To align with the goal of having 'a' on 'c' and 'c' on 'b', the immediate action that best progresses towards this configuration is to stack 'b' on 'c'. This will establish the required bottom two layers of the goal structure, with 'c' directly on 'b'. This sets up for the next move to place 'a' on 'c'.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Block A is on the table.
3. Block B is on top of Block C and Block B is clear.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block D is on the table and is clear.

This setup reflects the initial state of the environment involving the positions of the blocks relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and blocks B and C are still in a configuration that is opposite to the desired goal. The goal is to have 'a' on 'c' and 'c' on 'b', but currently, 'b' is on top of 'c'.

Think: To begin aligning the blocks according to the goal state, it is necessary to separate block B from block C. This will make block C available to be placed on block B eventually. The valid action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' will achieve this by moving block B away from block C, allowing for future rearrangement towards the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Here’s the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is positioned on top of block a.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is also on the table.

This setup involves the robot hand actively holding block b, while blocks a and d are directly on the table. Block c, being clear, is stackable, and it currently sits atop block a, which is also clear for further actions if needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal requires block C to be on top of block B, followed by block A on top of block C. Currently, block C is accessible as it is on top of block A.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, stacking block B under block C is essential. Using the valid action 'stack(b:default,c:default)' will position block B directly under block C, aligning with the goal. This action also keeps the robot hand free for future moves, such as manipulating block A.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Block A is on the table.
3. Block B is on top of Block C and Block B is clear.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block D is on the table and is clear.

This setup reflects the initial state of the environment involving the positions of the blocks relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment is back to the initial state with the robot hand empty and block B incorrectly placed on top of block C, contrary to the goal configuration.

Think: To achieve the goal structure, the first necessary step is to clear block C by removing block B from on top of it. This is because block C needs to be placed on top of block B as per the goal. The valid action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' directly addresses this by moving block B away from block C, thus clearing block C for the next critical steps towards achieving the goal.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Here’s the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is positioned on top of block a.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is also on the table.

This setup involves the robot hand actively holding block b, while blocks a and d are directly on the table. Block c, being clear, is stackable, and it currently sits atop block a, which is also clear for further actions if needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal state requires block C on top of block B, and subsequently block A on top of block C. At this point, block C is accessible as it is on top of block A.

Think: To align with the goal, the most direct and meaningful action is to stack block B under block C since the robot hand is holding B, and C is directly above A and clear. Utilizing the action 'stack(b:default,c:default)' will place B below C, which is a significant step towards the goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Block A is on the table.
3. Block B is on top of Block C and Block B is clear.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block D is on the table and is clear.

This setup reflects the initial state of the environment involving the positions of the blocks relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment has returned to its initial state with block B on top of block C. This arrangement does not comply with the goal state, where block C should be on top of block B, and block A on top of block C.

Think: The first necessary action to correct the current configuration is to clear block C by removing block B from on top of it. This will facilitate the later repositioning of block C beneath block A and above block B, aligning with the goal. The valid action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' is appropriate as it will separate block B from block C, making block C available for future moves.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Here’s the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is positioned on top of block a.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is also on the table.

This setup involves the robot hand actively holding block b, while blocks a and d are directly on the table. Block c, being clear, is stackable, and it currently sits atop block a, which is also clear for further actions if needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current state where the robot hand is holding block B, and the goal state requires block C on top of block B, and block A on top of block C, it's clear that the next step should ideally involve positioning block B beneath block C.

Think: The direct action that aligns with achieving the goal configuration at this stage is to stack block B on block C. This action will place block B directly under block C, which is a critical step towards the final goal configuration. With block C directly on top of block B, the path to placing block A on top of block C will be clearer.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Block A is on the table.
3. Block B is on top of Block C and Block B is clear.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block D is on the table and is clear.

This setup reflects the initial state of the environment involving the positions of the blocks relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The situation has returned to the initial state with block B incorrectly stacked on top of block C, which is opposite of the goal that requires block C to be on top of block B. The robot hand is empty, indicating readiness for an action involving block manipulation.

Think: To make progress towards the goal state where block 'c' is on top of block 'b', the first required action is to unstack block B from block C. This will free up block C, allowing for the subsequent repositioning necessary to achieve the goal configuration. The valid action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' precisely addresses this need by separating block B from block C.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Here’s the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is positioned on top of block a.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is also on the table.

This setup involves the robot hand actively holding block b, while blocks a and d are directly on the table. Block c, being clear, is stackable, and it currently sits atop block a, which is also clear for further actions if needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal is for block C to be on top of block B, with block A subsequently needing to be stacked on block C. Currently, block C is accessible as it is positioned on top of block A.

Think: To align with the goal, stacking block B under block C is the most strategic move. This action will set the foundation for the desired configuration by placing B directly under C. This is a significant step towards achieving the goal configuration. The valid action 'stack(b:default,c:default)' is directly applicable and moves the configuration closer to the goal.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block D is on the table and is clear.

This setup reflects the initial state of the environment involving the positions of the blocks relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Once again, we are at the initial state where the robot hand is empty and block B is incorrectly placed on top of block C, contrary to the goal requirement. The goal needs block C on top of block B.

Think: To correct the current configuration and align it with the goal, block B needs to be removed from atop block C. This is necessary to eventually place block C above block B. The valid action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' is suitable for this task as it will separate block B from block C, enabling the rearrangement needed to progress towards the goal.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Here’s the configuration of these blocks:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is positioned on top of block a.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is also on the table.

This setup involves the robot hand actively holding block b, while blocks a and d are directly on the table. Block c, being clear, is stackable, and it currently sits atop block a, which is also clear for further actions if needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block B, and the goal configuration requires block C to be on top of block B, and then block A on top of block C. Currently, block C is accessible as it is on top of block A.

Think: The next logical step towards achieving the goal is to stack block B under block C. This will place block B in the correct position as the base for block C, aligning with the goal's requirement. Using the valid action 'stack(b:default,c:default)' will achieve this configuration, preparing the setup for the final placement of block A.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

The goal in this scenario involves arranging a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial state is repeated with the robot hand empty and block B incorrectly positioned on top of block C, not aligning with the goal which requires block C on top of block B.

Think: The first action to rectify this configuration and move towards the goal is to free up block C by removing block B from on top of it. The 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' action is valid and essential as it separates block B from block C, allowing for the necessary reconfiguration to align with the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot holds block B, which needs to be positioned under block C according to the goal. Blocks A and D are on the table, with block C accessible on top of block A.

Think: The immediate step to progress towards the goal is to stack block B under block C. This action is aligned with the goal structure of having block C on top of block B. The valid action 'stack(b:default,c:default)' is the optimal choice as it positions block B directly under block C, setting up the stages for the final arrangement of block A.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The scene has reset to the initial state with the robot hand empty and block B still incorrectly placed on top of block C, which is contrary to the required goal state alignment.

Think: To correct the configuration and make progress toward the goal, it's essential to remove block B from atop block C, as the goal requires block C on top of block B. The action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' is pertinent as it will separate block B from block C, leaving block C available for the necessary repositioning.

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand is holding block B, and the goal state requires block C to be positioned on top of block B with block A subsequently stacked on block C. Block C is presently accessible as it is on top of block A.

Think: To progress towards the goal configuration, the immediate step is to stack block B under block C. This aligns with the goal's requirement of having block C on top of block B. The valid action 'stack(b:default,c:default)' will place block B directly under block C, setting up the correct base for the final arrangement of block A.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
