ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand are as follows:

- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks A and B are directly on the table.
- Block A and Block D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of these blocks.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any block. 

This setup is part of the Blocksworld domain, where the goal typically involves reconfiguring the blocks into a different arrangement using a series of actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current state and the goal state, the robot hand is empty and there are two immediate valid actions available: picking up block A or unstacking block D from block C. The goal is to reconfigure the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, which is on top of block D, which is then on top of block B.

Think: The final configuration requires block D to be directly on block B, so the current positioning of block D on block C aligns with the final requirement. However, to rearrange blocks according to the goal state, block D must be temporarily removed from block C. This will clear block C, allowing it to be eventually placed on block D. The first logical action is to unstack block D from block C since the hand is empty and this action is available.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks and their relation to the robot hand are as follows:

- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is currently being held by the robot's hand.
- Both Blocks A and B are positioned on the table.
- Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. 

This setup provides a clear view of the block arrangement and the status of the robot's interaction with them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block D, and the goal is to have block D placed on top of block B. However, block C is currently on top of block B, which means block D cannot directly be placed on B yet.

Think: To progress towards the goal configuration, block D needs to be placed on block B eventually. Since block C is blocking this action and block D cannot be placed on B directly in its current state, the best immediate action is to put down block D on the table. This will free up the robot's hand and allow further actions to rearrange block C, eventually leading to the desired configuration.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the following scenario is observed with four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D:

- Block C is stacked on top of Block B.
- Blocks A, B, and D are directly on the table.
- Block D, Block A, and Block C are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup provides a clear snapshot of the positions and statuses of all the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the goal requires specific stacking of blocks: A on C, C on D, and D on B. Currently, D and A are on the table, and C is stacked on B.

Think: The next step should work towards freeing up block B to eventually allow stacking D on it. To do this, block C needs to be moved. Since block C is on top of B and the goal requires C to be above D, a logical step is to remove C from B. This action is available and aligns with the goal of reconfiguring the blocks as specified.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table. Block C is being held by the robot hand. Additionally, blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This setup allows for actions such as placing block C on any of the clear blocks or back on the table, or moving other blocks if the robot hand becomes empty.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand holding block C and blocks A, B, and D clear on the table, the immediate goal is to arrange the blocks to meet the configuration where A is on C, C on D, and D on B. 

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, placing block C directly on block D is a crucial step, as it matches the goal of having block C on top of block D. This action is supported by the current valid actions and is a strategic move towards the final arrangement.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup is as follows:
- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table and it is clear.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table, but it is not clear because Block C is on top of it.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the current block configuration places C on D, aligning with part of the goal state. However, to achieve the final goal, D needs to be on top of B, which currently isn't possible due to D being under C.

Think: To reach the goal configuration where D is on B, block C needs to be temporarily moved. Since the robot hand is empty and unstacking C from D is available, this action will free D to be later placed on B.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table. Block C is being held by the robot hand. Additionally, blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This setup allows for actions such as placing block C on any of the clear blocks or back on the table, or moving other blocks if the robot hand becomes empty.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block C, and the goal requires block C to be placed on top of block D. This action will align with the final configuration, where block C is directly on block D, which is to be eventually on block B.

Think: Since block D is clear and available on the table, and the desired goal configuration involves stacking block C on block D, the most direct and meaningful action is to stack block C onto block D. This action is valid and strategically moves closer to achieving the final goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup is as follows:
- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table and it is clear.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table, but it is not clear because Block C is on top of it.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration now has block C stacked on block D, which aligns partially with the goal state. However, for the complete goal configuration, block D needs to be on top of block B. The robot hand is empty, which allows for the manipulation of blocks.

Think: Since block D needs to be placed on B, but is currently under C, the necessary action is to free D by moving C. The valid action available to remove C from D is to unstack block C from block D. This action will make D clear and ready to be moved onto B in subsequent steps.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table. Block C is being held by the robot hand. Additionally, blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This setup allows for actions such as placing block C on any of the clear blocks or back on the table, or moving other blocks if the robot hand becomes empty.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block C, and the goal is a specific configuration where block D needs to be placed on block B. Currently, block D is clear and on the table.

Think: To align with the goal state, block C should be stacked on block D, which is one of the valid actions available. This placement is crucial as it sets the stage for eventually placing block D on top of block B, moving us closer to the goal configuration.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup is as follows:
- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table and it is clear.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table, but it is not clear because Block C is on top of it.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has block C stacked on block D, which matches part of the goal state configuration. However, for the final configuration, block D needs to be placed on top of block B. The robot hand is empty, ready to manipulate blocks.

Think: To eventually place block D onto block B, block C needs to be moved off block D first. The valid action to achieve this is unstacking block C from block D. Taking this action will make block D clear and facilitate the next step of moving block D onto block B.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table. Block C is being held by the robot hand.

This setup allows for actions such as placing block C on any of the clear blocks or back on the table, or moving other blocks if the robot hand becomes empty.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block C, and the goal state requires block C to be stacked on top of block D. Block D is currently clear and available for stacking on the table.

Think: Given the goal configuration and the current status of the blocks, the next logical step is to stack block C on top of block D. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state requirements and is a valid action at this moment.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup is as follows:
- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table and it is clear.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table, but it is not clear because Block C is on top of it.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has block C already stacked on block D, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, for the complete goal configuration, block D needs to be on top of block B. The robot hand is empty, ready for action.

Think: To facilitate moving block D onto block B, and ultimately aiming towards the goal configuration, block C needs to be moved from its current position on top of D. The valid action available to achieve this is unstacking block C from block D. This will make block D clear and able to be moved or stacked as needed.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, forming a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block C, and the goal configuration requires block C to be directly on top of block D, which is then on top of block B. Currently, block D is clear and placed on the table.

Think: Given the goal and the current state, the most effective action now is to stack block C on top of block D. This directly aligns block C with its required position in the goal configuration and prepares us for the final step of placing block D on top of block B in subsequent moves.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state aligns with part of the goal, specifically with block C on top of block D. However, to achieve the goal state, block D needs to be placed on top of block B. The robot hand is empty, which allows for manipulation of blocks.

Think: Since block D needs to be placed on B, and block C is currently on top of D, the logical action is to free D by moving C. The valid action available to achieve this is unstacking block C from block D. This will make D clear and allow for subsequent actions to move D onto block B.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state matches part of the goal with block C on top of block D, but to meet the full goal, block D needs to be placed on top of block B. The robot's hand is empty, enabling further block manipulation.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block D is on block B, it's necessary to make block D available for movement. This requires removing block C from atop block D. The available action to accomplish this is unstacking block C from block D, which will make block D clear and available for subsequent placement on block B.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)
