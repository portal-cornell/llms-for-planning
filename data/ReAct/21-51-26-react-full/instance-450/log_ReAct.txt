ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block D is on top of Block B.
2. The robot hand is currently empty.
3. Block E is on the table and clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
4. Block B is also on the table.
5. Block A is on top of Block C, and Block A is clear.
6. Block C is on top of Block D.

This setup describes a scenario where the blocks are stacked in two separate columns: one column with C at the bottom, D in the middle, and A on top, and another column with just B on the table. Block E is also alone on the table. The goal in this environment would typically involve rearranging these blocks to match a desired configuration, utilizing the robot's ability to move blocks based on whether they are clear and the hand is empty.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block D is on top of block A, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will form a vertical stack of blocks C, A, D, and E from bottom to top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment operates with specific rules on how blocks can be manipulated, depending on their current configuration and the status of the robot hand. Valid actions are only possible when conditions such as 'clear' and 'hand empty' are met.

Think: To achieve the goal state of stacking C, A, D, and E from bottom to top, we need to rearrange the blocks accordingly. Since Block A is already on top of Block C, it's in the right initial position, and the robot hand is empty. The first step should be to free up Block D, which is currently on top of Block B and has Block C underneath. However, since neither Block B nor Block D is involved in any valid actions currently listed, and Block E is clear and alone on the table, the immediate actionable step from the valid actions is to manipulate Block E.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block d is on top of block b.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block a is on top of block c.
- Block c is on top of block d, creating a vertical stack from d to a.
- The robot hand is currently holding block e.
- Block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

This setup suggests a complex stacking of the blocks with one block being manipulated by the robot, and another block that is free to have another block placed on it or be moved.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block D is on top of block A, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will form a vertical stack of blocks C, A, D, and E from bottom to top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration and the robot's hand status are crucial for determining the feasible actions. The robot is currently holding block E, which aligns with the requirement in the goal state for block E to be on top. Given the valid actions and the goal state configuration, strategic placement of block E is essential.

Think: To build towards the goal state of stacking blocks C, A, D, and E in order from bottom to top, the current placement of blocks needs to be considered. Block A, which is clear and on top of block C, can directly receive block E. Since the goal state requires block E to be on top of block D (which itself needs to be on top of block A), stacking E on A now would be premature. However, placing E down on the table or stacking it on A does not progress towards the goal state configuration.

Action: put-down(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block D is on top of Block B.
2. The robot hand is currently empty.
3. Block E is on the table and clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
4. Block B is also on the table.
5. Block A is on top of Block C, and Block A is clear.
6. Block C is on top of Block D.

This setup describes a scenario where the blocks are stacked in two separate columns: one column with C at the bottom, D in the middle, and A on top, and another column with just B on the table. Block E is also alone on the table. The goal in this environment would typically involve rearranging these blocks to match a desired configuration, utilizing the robot's ability to move blocks based on whether they are clear and the hand is empty.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block D is on top of block A, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will form a vertical stack of blocks C, A, D, and E from bottom to top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment dictates that actions can only be performed on blocks that are clear and when the robot hand's status allows it (either empty for picking up or holding a block for placing). Since the robot's hand is empty, actions involving picking up a clear block or unstacking a clear block from another are viable.

Think: Looking at the goal of stacking blocks C, A, D, and E in ascending order, and considering the current state where Block A is already on C but needs to have D above it, the immediate need is to rearrange D and E. Block E is clear and on the table, making it immediately actionable. Picking up E will allow for future actions to place it correctly after rearranging D and A.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block d is on top of block b.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block a is on top of block c.
- Block c is on top of block d, creating a vertical stack from d to a.
- The robot hand is currently holding block e.
- Block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

This setup suggests a complex stacking of the blocks with one block being manipulated by the robot, and another block that is free to have another block placed on it or be moved.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block D is on top of block A, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will form a vertical stack of blocks C, A, D, and E from bottom to top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Understanding the structure and the robot's current state (holding block E) is crucial for making appropriate moves. The robot can either put block E down or stack it on top of block A. However, considering the goal state, stacking E directly on A at this moment will not align with the desired final configuration, which should be C, A, D, E from bottom to top.

Think: The robot's current action should facilitate the future arrangement of the blocks in the goal state order. Since block A needs to have block D on top of it before block E can be placed, the robot should first focus on reorganizing blocks D and A. Therefore, putting down block E temporarily to free the robot's hand allows for future rearrangement of the other blocks to meet the goal configuration.

Action: put-down(e:default)

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state and the goal state both have Block A on top of Block C, so any action involving the separation of these two blocks (like unstacking A from C) would be counterproductive. The robot hand is empty, which permits actions such as picking up a clear block.

Think: The goal is to rearrange the blocks in the order C, A, D, E from bottom to top. Currently, Block D is not in the correct position as it needs to be placed on top of Block A. In order to achieve this configuration, the robot will eventually need to move Block D. However, as the current valid actions are to pick up Block E or unstack Block A from Block C, the most immediate and non-disruptive action is to pick up Block E, which is clear and on the table. This action does not interfere with the ultimate goal arrangement and prepares for subsequent moves.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

This setup suggests a complex stacking of the blocks with one block being manipulated by the robot, and another block that is free to have another block placed on it or be moved.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block D is on top of block A, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will form a vertical stack of blocks C, A, D, and E from bottom to top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the robot is currently holding block E, and the goal is to stack blocks in the order of C, A, D, E from bottom to top, the next move needs to facilitate reaching this configuration. Since block A is already on top of block C, and block D needs to be placed on top of block A, stacking block E directly on block A at this stage would not align with the final desired configuration.

Think: The best action now is to put down block E, which will free up the robot's hand to manipulate other blocks, particularly block D, which needs to be repositioned above block A as specified in the goal state. Putting block E down will not disrupt the current configuration and allows for future strategic moves to align with the goal state.

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block D is on top of Block B.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current valid actions suggest that moving Block A from Block C (unstack(a:default,c:default)) is not aligned with the goal state, as Block A is already correctly placed on top of Block C in the current configuration. The robot hand is empty, and Block E is clear and on the table, which allows for its manipulation without disrupting the current correct arrangement of A and C.

Think: The ultimate goal is to stack C, A, D, and E in that order. Currently, Block D is not in the correct position, as it is on top of Block B. The priority should be preparing to reposition Block D. Picking up Block E does not directly contribute to achieving the goal configuration but will enable subsequent moves by keeping the robot's hand occupied, potentially limiting future actions. However, since it's the only action aside from unstacking A from C (which would be counterproductive), picking up E is the sensible choice to keep the options open.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal is to arrange the blocks in the order C, A, D, E from bottom to top. Given that block A is already correctly positioned on top of block C, the next steps should strategically move towards placing block D and then block E accordingly. However, stacking E directly on A now would not allow D to be placed between them later, as required by the goal state.

Think: The priority should be to reposition block D correctly above block A. Since the robot is currently holding block E and cannot move block D while holding another block, the immediate action that makes sense is to put down block E. This will free up the robot's hand, allowing for future actions to focus on rearranging block D as needed.

Action: put-down(e:default)

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It's crucial to recognize that Block A is already correctly placed on top of Block C, matching part of the goal state configuration. Given the robot's empty hand and the configuration of blocks, the action to unstack Block A from Block C would contradict the goal state. 

Think: The goal is to stack the blocks in the order C, A, D, E from bottom to top. Block D needs to be moved on top of Block A. However, currently, D is on top of B, which makes it inaccessible for stacking directly on A. Block E, being clear and on the table, is a candidate for movement but picking it up does not immediately contribute to achieving the goal configuration unless it's part of a sequence to rearrange D. The direct movement of D is not available yet, so picking up E keeps the robot active and may open up future valid actions to adjust D after reevaluating the state post-move.

- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal is to stack blocks in the order of C, A, D, E from bottom to top. Block A is already properly placed atop Block C, but Block D needs to be positioned on Block A before E can be correctly placed on top of D. Stacking E on A at this moment would be premature since it would prevent placing D in its required position.

Think: Given the goal structure and the current state of the blocks, placing E down is the most strategic move. This action will free the robot's hand, allowing for subsequent adjustments, particularly the necessary repositioning of Block D. Since stacking E on A now would misalign the desired final configuration, the robot should put E down to keep options open for correctly placing D afterward.

Reflect: The goal configuration requires that Block A remains on Block C, so any action like unstack(a:default,c:default) that disrupts this arrangement should be avoided. The robot's hand is currently empty, making the action of picking up a clear block viable.

Think: To achieve the goal state of stacking blocks C, A, D, and E in that order from bottom to top, it is essential to first address the rearrangement of Block D. Since Block D is currently on Block B and needs to be moved on top of Block A, the robot first needs to prepare to manipulate Block D.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal configuration specifically requires Block A to remain on top of Block C, so the action to unstack A from C would not align with achieving the goal state. Therefore, this action should be avoided. The robot's hand is empty, which means it can engage with any clear block available for manipulation.

Think: Since the goal is to stack the blocks in the order C, A, D, and E from bottom to top, and considering the robot hand is empty, the first step is to start manipulating the blocks that can be moved without disrupting the desired final configuration. Currently, Block E is clear and on the table, making it a viable block to be picked up. This action will allow us to prepare for subsequent rearrangements, specifically focusing on repositioning Block D.

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal is to stack blocks in the order of C, A, D, E from bottom to top. Placing E directly on A now would be premature since it would prevent placing D in its required position between A and E.

Think: Given that the robot's hand is occupied with block E and the ultimate arrangement requires D to be placed on A before E can be correctly stacked on D, the immediate action should facilitate future placement of D. Therefore, putting down E is the most strategic move. This action will free the robot's hand, allowing for subsequent adjustments to position Block D correctly above Block A. Stacking E on A at this stage would disrupt the necessary sequence to achieve the goal configuration.

Action: put-down(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block D is on top of Block B.
2. The robot hand is currently empty.
3. Block E is on the table and clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
4. Block B is also on the table.
5. Block A is on top of Block C, and Block A is clear.
6. Block C is on top of Block D.

This setup describes a scenario where the blocks are stacked in two separate columns: one column with C at the bottom, D in the middle, and A on top, and another column with just B on the table. Block E is also alone on the table. The goal in this environment would typically involve rearranging these blocks to match a desired configuration, utilizing the robot's ability to move blocks based on whether they are clear and the hand is empty.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block D is on top of block A, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will form a vertical stack of blocks C, A, D, and E from bottom to top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal configuration specifies block A on top of block C, block D on top of block A, and block E on top of block D. The action to unstack A from C would conflict with achieving the goal state as it already aligns with part of the goal configuration. The robot's hand is empty, which means picking up a block is feasible.

Think: The immediate need is to adjust the positions of blocks D and E to achieve the goal stacking order of C, A, D, E. Since block D is currently on top of block B and not involved in the valid actions, manipulating block E, which is clear and on the table, is a viable option. Picking up block E will keep the robot's hand occupied and may lead to future actions that could involve repositioning block D.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block d is on top of block b.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block a is on top of block c.
- Block c is on top of block d, creating a vertical stack from d to a.
- The robot hand is currently holding block e.
- Block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

This setup suggests a complex stacking of the blocks with one block being manipulated by the robot, and another block that is free to have another block placed on it or be moved.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block D is on top of block A, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will form a vertical stack of blocks C, A, D, and E from bottom to top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot currently holds block E, and the goal is to stack blocks in the sequence of C, A, D, E from bottom to top. Given that block A is already correctly positioned atop block C, the next step should ideally focus on positioning block D. However, the current valid actions only involve block E, which can either be put down or stacked on block A.

Think: Stacking E on A at this point would be premature and counterproductive, as it would prevent placing D between A and E, which is necessary according to the goal state. The most strategic move under the current constraints is to put down block E. This action will free the robot's hand, allowing for potential future manipulation of block D to achieve the desired configuration.

Valid Actions:

- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal configuration requires that Block A remains on Block C, so the action to unstack A from C would be counterproductive. The robot's hand is empty, making the action of picking up a clear block viable.

Think: To achieve the goal state of stacking blocks C, A, D, and E in that order from bottom to top, it is essential to first address the rearrangement of Block D. Since Block D is currently on top of Block B and needs to be moved on top of Block A, the robot first needs to prepare to manipulate Block D. Picking up Block E, which is an action currently available and aligns with keeping the robot active, does not directly progress towards the goal but prepares for future rearrangements by keeping the robot's hand occupied.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal is to stack blocks in the order of C, A, D, E from bottom to top. With block A already properly placed atop Block C, the next critical step is to position Block D on top of Block A, as per the goal configuration. Currently, holding E limits the robot's options for manipulating other blocks, particularly Block D.

Think: Since placing E directly on A now would be premature and obstruct the needed placement of D on A, the strategic move is to put down E. This action will free the robot's hand, allowing for subsequent adjustments to position Block D correctly above Block A. Stacking E on A at this stage would disrupt the necessary sequence to achieve the goal configuration.
