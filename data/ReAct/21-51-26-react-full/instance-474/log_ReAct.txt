ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. The robot hand is empty. Here's a summary of the configuration and status of each component:

- Block D is on the table and is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block A is stacked on top of Block B and is clear.
- Block B is directly underneath Block A and is on top of Block C.
- Block C is underneath Block B and supports Block E on top of it.
- Block E is on the table and is also supported by Block C.

The objective in this scenario, typically, would be to rearrange these blocks to achieve a specified configuration, using the robot hand to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack blocks as necessary.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Given the current valid actions, I need to carefully consider which blocks can be directly interacted with by the robot hand. The robot hand is empty, letting it either pick up a clear block from the table or unstack a clear block from another block.

Think:
To achieve the goal state, Block B must be on top of Block A, and Block C must be on top of Block B. Therefore, Block A needs to be clear, which it currently is. However, Block B is not currently clear as it is below Block A. The immediate clear blocks I can interact with are Block D (on the table) and Block A (on top of Block B). Since picking up Block D does not help in achieving the goal in the current move, the sensible action, in this case, would be to unstack Block A from Block B. This will make Block B clear and available for further rearrangement.

Action: 
unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have a total of five objects: blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here's the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block a is currently being held by the robot hand.
2. Block b is clear and is positioned on top of block c.
3. Block c is placed on top of block e.
4. Block d is clear and is also on the table.
5. Block e is sitting directly on the table.

This setup presents a complex arrangement where the robot can manipulate these blocks to achieve a desired configuration, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
Considering the current state, the robot hand is holding Block A, which needs to be strategically placed to help achieve the goal configuration. This requires evaluating the available actions to make the most effective move.

Think:
The goal state requires Block B to be on top of Block A and Block C on top of Block B. Since Block B is currently clear and on top of Block C, stacking Block A on Block B will align with the goal configuration. This action will also help in further steps to rearrange the other blocks accordingly. The other stacking option, placing Block A on Block D, doesn't directly contribute to the goal configuration and should be avoided at this stage.

Action:
stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. The robot hand is empty. Here's a summary of the configuration and status of each component:

- Block D is on the table and is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block A is stacked on top of Block B and is clear.
- Block B is directly underneath Block A and is on top of Block C.
- Block C is underneath Block B and supports Block E on top of it.
- Block E is on the table and is also supported by Block C.

The objective in this scenario, typically, would be to rearrange these blocks to achieve a specified configuration, using the robot hand to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack blocks as necessary.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The robot hand is currently empty, and the only actions available involve manipulating Blocks A and D. To progress towards the goal state, we need to consider how to free up Blocks B, C, and E for reconfiguration, as their arrangement is crucial for achieving the desired end state.

Think:
From the current configuration, Block A is stacked on Block B, which is not in the desired final arrangement. The goal state requires Block B to be on top of Block A, not the other way around. Therefore, unstacking Block A from Block B is necessary to eventually rearrange them correctly. This action will also make Block B available for further manipulation, such as stacking Block C on it later, aligning with the goal state requirements.

Action:
unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have a total of five objects: blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here's the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block a is currently being held by the robot hand.
2. Block b is clear and is positioned on top of block c.
3. Block c is placed on top of block e.
4. Block d is clear and is also on the table.
5. Block e is sitting directly on the table.

This setup presents a complex arrangement where the robot can manipulate these blocks to achieve a desired configuration, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
Given that the robot hand is currently holding Block A, the actions available involve either putting down Block A or stacking it on another clear block. The goal configuration requires specific arrangements which must be critically considered in choosing the next action.

Think:
The goal state requires Block B to be on top of Block A. Since Block B is currently on top of Block C and is clear, stacking Block A directly on Block B aligns perfectly with the goal configuration's requirement for Block A and Block B. This action will progress us towards the goal state by correctly placing these two blocks in their desired final positions.

Action:
stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. The robot hand is empty. Here's a summary of the configuration and status of each component:

- Block D is on the table and is clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block A is stacked on top of Block B and is clear.
- Block B is directly underneath Block A and is on top of Block C.
- Block C is underneath Block B and supports Block E on top of it.
- Block E is on the table and is also supported by Block C.

The objective in this scenario, typically, would be to rearrange these blocks to achieve a specified configuration, using the robot hand to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack blocks as necessary.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
Currently, the robot hand is empty, and the available actions involve manipulating Blocks A and D. Understanding the final goal configuration, it's essential to rearrange the blocks accordingly. Block A being on top of Block B in the current configuration doesn't fit the goal state requirement.

Think:
To move towards the goal state, Block B needs to be on top of Block A, not the other way around. Thus, unstacking Block A from Block B is a strategic move that aligns with the goal configuration. This action will free up Block B, allowing for further manipulation, specifically placing Block C on top of Block B later, which is necessary to meet the goal state. Picking up Block D does not immediately contribute to achieving the goal state configuration.

Action:
unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have a total of five objects: blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here's the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block a is currently being held by the robot hand.
2. Block b is clear and is positioned on top of block c.
3. Block c is placed on top of block e.
4. Block d is clear and is also on the table.
5. Block e is sitting directly on the table.

This setup presents a complex arrangement where the robot can manipulate these blocks to achieve a desired configuration, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The robot hand is holding Block A, and the current actions available involve placing Block A either on Block B, Block D, or on the table. The goal configuration specifies Block B should be on top of Block A, so the immediate priority should be to correctly place Block A to facilitate this arrangement.

Think:
Stacking Block A directly on Block B right now would not align with the goal since Block B needs to be on top of Block A, not underneath it. Considering the other valid actions, putting down Block A on the table or stacking it on Block D would be strategic moves. Since stacking on D does not contribute directly to the goal state, the best action to free up the robot hand while keeping Block A in a clear and accessible position is to put Block A down on the table. This will also keep the environment tidy for making necessary moves later.

Action:
put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are five objects identified as blocks a, b, c, d, and e. Describing the state of these blocks:

- Block a is directly on the table and has nothing on top, making it clear.
- Block b is stacked on block c and is also clear.
- Block c is directly on top of block e.
- Block d is on the table and clear.
- Block e is on the table with block c on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating that no blocks are being held by the robot. This setup forms the starting or current configuration of the blocks in the Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The robot hand is empty, and the available actions include picking up clear blocks (A and D) or unstacking Block B from Block C. The goal configuration requires a specific stacking order, so each move must be calculated to progress towards this arrangement without unnecessary repositioning.

Think:
To move towards the goal state:
- Block B must be placed on top of Block A.
- Block C must be placed on top of Block B.
- Block D must be placed on top of Block E.
- Block E must be placed on top of Block C.

Currently, Block B is stacked on Block C, which is not the desired final position. Unstacking Block B from Block C will make Block B available and clear, allowing it to be subsequently placed onto Block A (after repositioning Block A appropriately). Picking up Block A or Block D at this stage does not immediately contribute to achieving the goal configuration, as their final positions depend on the placement of other blocks.

Action:
unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five blocks named A, B, C, D, and E. Currently, blocks A, D, and E are positioned on the table. Block C is stacked on top of block E. The robot's hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D have no other blocks on top of them, making them clear.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
With the robot hand currently holding Block B, and considering the goal state requirements, the choices involve placing Block B in a position that progresses towards the final desired configuration. The validity of the actions provided allows for strategic placement of Block B.

Think:
The goal state requires Block B to be placed on top of Block A. This matches one of the valid actions available and directly facilitates the desired final arrangement without unnecessary repositioning. Stacking Block B on Blocks C or D does not align with the goal state and would complicate the sequence of moves needed to reach the goal. Therefore, placing Block B directly on Block A is the most effective move at this stage.

Action:
stack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Blocks A, E, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block E.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing placed on these blocks.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it's not holding any blocks.

This setup outlines the initial state of the blocks relative to each other and their position concerning the table and the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
- unstack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The robot hand is empty, and the available actions include picking up Block D or unstacking either Block B from Block A or Block C from Block E. The goal configuration requires a specific stacking sequence for all blocks, so each action must be chosen to effectively advance towards this arrangement.

Think:
The goal state requires Block C to be placed on top of Block B. Block C is currently on top of Block E, which is not its final position. To free up Block C and make it available for stacking onto Block B later, it would be strategic to unstack Block C from Block E. This move aligns with the goal state by preparing Block C for repositioning. Picking up Block D or unstacking Block B from Block A at this point does not directly contribute to progressing towards the goal configuration.

Action:
unstack(c:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the Blocksworld environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A has Block B on top of it, and is placed directly on the table.
- Block B is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block C is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block D is clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block E is also clear and placed directly on the table.

This setup indicates various clear blocks and the location of each block, either being on the table, on another block, or held by the robot.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The robot hand is currently holding Block C, and the goal configuration requires Block C to be placed on top of Block B. The valid actions available allow for several stacking possibilities with Block C.

Think:
Looking at the goal state, Block C needs to be stacked on top of Block B. This matches one of the valid actions and aligns perfectly with the goal configuration. Stacking Block C on Blocks D or E at this point would not contribute to achieving the goal state directly and could complicate further moves. Placing Block C on Block B will set up the next steps for placing Block E and Block D correctly according to the goal state.

Action:
stack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described scenario, the environment consists of five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. These blocks are either positioned on the table or stacked on top of each other. Specifically:

- Block A is on the table, with Block B stacked on top of it.
- Block B is directly above Block A and is not supporting any other block, making it clear.
- Block C is clear and is positioned directly on top of Block B.
- Block D is on the table and is clear, not supporting any other blocks.
- Block E is also on the table and is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty, allowing it to perform actions such as picking up a clear block or stacking one block on another. This setup is crucial for planning how to rearrange the blocks to achieve any desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The current state almost matches the goal state, except for the positions of Blocks D, E, and C. The robot's hand is empty, which means actions can be taken to rearrange these blocks as needed to meet the goal configuration.

Think:
According to the goal state:
- Block B is already correctly placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is correctly placed on top of Block B.
- Block D needs to be placed on top of Block E.
- Block E needs to be placed on top of Block C.

Currently, Block D and Block E are clear and on the table, but Block C is already correctly placed, so unstacking it would be counterproductive. The direct actions that would contribute to achieving the goal state are picking up either Block D or Block E. As the goal requires Block E to be placed on top of Block C, the action of picking up Block E is more aligned with achieving the final configuration. This would allow for Block E to be then stacked on Block C in a subsequent action.

Action:
pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, we have five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block c is stacked on top of block b.
- Block b is on top of block a.
- Blocks a and d are both placed directly on the table.
- Blocks c and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block e.

This setup involves both vertical stacking of the blocks and individual blocks resting clear on the table. The robot is engaged with block e, providing opportunities for manipulation using actions like putting down or stacking block e.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The current state shows that blocks A, B, and C are already in a partially aligned configuration with the goal state, where Block C is on top of Block B, and Block B is on top of Block A. The robot hand is holding Block E, and given the goal configuration, strategic placement of Block E is crucial.

Think:
The goal state requires Block E to be placed on top of Block C. This aligns perfectly with one of the valid actions available, which is to stack Block E on Block C. Performing this action will place Block E correctly according to the goal configuration and prepare for the subsequent placement of Block D on top of Block E, as required by the goal state. Stacking Block E on Block D would not contribute towards achieving the goal state at this stage.

Action:
stack(e:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. These blocks and their arrangements are as follows:

- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block E is on top of Block C.
- Blocks A and D are directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.
- Blocks D and E are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This setup depicts a tower of blocks involving A, B, C, and E, with D being isolated and directly on the table. The robot is ready to manipulate these blocks as its hand is empty and certain blocks are accessible (clear).
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(e:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The current configuration is close to the goal state, except for the positions of Blocks D and E. Block E needs to be on top of Block C, which is correctly placed, but Block D needs to be on top of Block E. The robot hand is empty, allowing for manipulation of clear blocks, specifically Block D and Block E.

Think:
Since Block E is already on top of Block C and should stay there according to the goal state, unstacking E from C would be counterproductive. The next logical step is to prepare Block D to be stacked on Block E. Since Block D is clear and on the table, picking up Block D is strategically sound, setting it up to be stacked on Block E in a subsequent move, which aligns perfectly with the goal state.

Action:
pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld setup, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the configuration of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand:

1. Block c is placed on top of block b.
2. The robot's hand is holding block d.
3. Block a is positioned on the table.
4. Block e is stacked on block c and is clear, meaning there is no block on top of e.
5. Block b is stacked on block a.

This setup involves various blocks either being on the table, stacked on top of each other, or being held by the robot hand, with block e being the only one clear and ready for further action without any rearrangement.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment, which involves a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand within a Blocksworld setup, is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the following configuration:
- Block B is placed on top of Block A.
- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block D is placed on top of Block E.
- Block E is placed on top of Block C.

This configuration requires the robot to strategically move the blocks, either by picking them up or unstacking them, and then placing or stacking them on the appropriate blocks to meet the desired final state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
The robot hand is holding Block D, and Block E is positioned appropriately to align with the goal state, where Block D needs to be placed on top of Block E. This provides a clear pathway to progress towards the goal state using the valid actions available.

Think:
Given the goal configuration, Block D must be stacked on Block E, and this is exactly one of the valid actions possible at this moment. This action directly aligns with achieving part of the goal state. Since Block E is already on top of Block C, stacking Block D on Block E will correctly set up that part of the desired configuration without needing any further rearrangement for these specific blocks.
