ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block 'd' is on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'c'.
- Both blocks 'b' and 'c' are directly on the table.
- Blocks 'd' and 'a' are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup implies that blocks 'a' and 'd' are available to be picked up or moved by the robot hand, while blocks 'b' and 'c' support other blocks, restricting their immediate movement.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange some of the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block B. This setup involves manipulating the blocks such that they achieve this stacked order.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot's hand is empty, the appropriate action is to use either 'unstack' command to move block 'a' or block 'd' from their current positions. Both actions are valid in this scenario.

Think: To achieve the goal of having block 'a' on top of block 'd' which is on top of block 'b', block 'd' needs to be directly on block 'b'. Since block 'd' is already on 'b', the first step should involve freeing block 'a' from its current position on block 'c' to eventually stack it atop block 'd'.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four objects: three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and one labeled 'd'. The current configuration and state of these objects are as follows:

- Block 'd' is on top of block 'b'.
- Both blocks 'b' and 'c' are directly on the table.
- Block 'c' has nothing on top, making it clear.
- Block 'd' is also clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'.

This setup indicates that blocks 'b' and 'c' are at the base level on the table, block 'd' is placed on block 'b', and the robot hand is occupied with block 'a'. Both blocks 'c' and 'd' are in a state where they can have other blocks placed on them or be moved without rearranging other blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange some of the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block B. This setup involves manipulating the blocks such that they achieve this stacked order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'a', which needs to be stacked on block 'd' according to the goal. The actions available include stacking 'a' on either 'c' or 'd'. 

Think: To align with the goal of having block 'a' on top of block 'd' which is already correctly on top of block 'b', the most straightforward action is to stack 'a' directly onto 'd'. This action will progress towards the goal state without any unnecessary steps.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)
