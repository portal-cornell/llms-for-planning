ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand's status is as follows:

- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block B is directly on top of Block C.
- Block C and Block D are both placed on the table.
- Block D is clear, meaning no other block is placed on it.
- Block A is also clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the initial state of the blocks with respect to each other and their placement relative to the table, along with the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed on top of other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there's nothing on it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows a stacking configuration that differs significantly from the goal state. The valid actions available suggest the robot's next move should involve manipulating either block A or D.

Think: To progress towards the goal, the first necessary step is to free block A from its current position on top of block B so that it can later be positioned as required by the goal state. The action "unstack(a:default,b:default)" will allow me to move block A and make it available for further manipulation.

Action: unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Block b is placed on top of block c, and the robot hand is holding block a. Both block b and block d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Blocks c and d are positioned on the table. This setup illustrates the blocks' arrangement and the robot's interaction with them in this particular scenario.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed on top of other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there's nothing on it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block A, which is a crucial step towards achieving the goal state configuration. The available actions suggest possibilities to either put down block A or stack it on top of blocks B or D.

Think: The goal requires block A to be on top of block D, and then block C on top of block A. Since block D is clear and on the table, the immediate and strategic move is to stack block A on top of block D as specified in the goal state.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block A is on top of Block D.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Both Blocks D and C are positioned on the table.
- Blocks A and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, ready to pick up or manipulate blocks.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed on top of other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there's nothing on it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that block A is already on top of block D, aligning partially with the goal state. However, block C needs to be placed on top of block A, which is currently not feasible due to block B being on top of block C.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, where block C needs to be on top of block A, it's necessary to first free up block C. This can be achieved by removing block B from on top of block C. The action "unstack(b:default,c:default)" will allow block C to be clear and available for subsequent stacking.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. Block A is clear and is placed on top of Block D.
2. Block B is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block C is clear and is placed on the table.
4. Block D is on the table.

The robot hand can perform actions to rearrange these blocks, aiming to achieve a specific configuration as per given goals (if any). The blocks can be moved from their current locations, stacked on top of another block, or placed back on the table by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed on top of other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there's nothing on it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We're nearing the goal state with block A on top of block D. Block C is clear and needs to be placed on top of block A. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B, which isn't needed for achieving the goal state configuration.

Think: To place block C on top of block A, we need to ensure that block B is not interfering. The best action is to put down block B so the robot hand is free to manipulate block C in future steps. Since the goal doesn't require block B to be on top of another block, putting it down is the optimal choice.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and one robot hand. Here is the configuration and status of each:

1. Block A is on top of Block D and nothing is on top of Block A, making it clear.
2. Block B is clear and is placed directly on the table.
3. Block C is also clear and located on the table.
4. Block D is on the table with Block A on top of it, so it is not clear.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup describes the initial or current state of the blocks and the status of the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed on top of other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there's nothing on it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state is very close to the goal state, with block A already correctly positioned on top of block D. The next critical step involves positioning block C on top of block A to complete the goal configuration.

Think: Since the robot hand is empty and block C is clear and available on the table, the most straightforward action is to pick up block C. This will enable the robot to subsequently stack it on block A, aligning with the goal state.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld setup, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The block d is on the table, block a is stacked on top of block d, and block b is also on the table. Both blocks a and b are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed on top of other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there's nothing on it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block C, which is a key element to achieving the goal state. Since block A is already correctly positioned on top of block D, the next required action is to place block C on top of block A.

Think: The valid actions include the option to stack block C directly on block A. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state requirements, positioning block C exactly where it needs to be to meet the goal criteria.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
