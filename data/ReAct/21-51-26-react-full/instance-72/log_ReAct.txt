ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:
- Block D is placed on the table.
- Block A is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block C is also on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block C.
Additionally, both Block A and Block B are clear, meaning no other blocks are placed on top of them. The robot hand is currently empty. This setup forms the initial configuration of blocks and the status of the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block B positioned on top of block C and block D positioned on top of block B. This configuration involves stacking block B onto block C and then stacking block D onto block B.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The valid actions provided suggest that only unstacking operations are currently feasible. Since the goal is to stack blocks in a specific order, unstacking might be a preparatory step to rearrange the blocks as needed.

Think: Since the goal is to have B on C and then D on B, and B is already on C, there's no need to unstack B from C at this point. However, to stack D on B, I need to ensure that D is free to move. Currently, D is below A, so I should first unstack A from D to free D.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, we have four objects named a, b, c, and d. Hereâ€™s the current configuration:

- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block d is on the table and there is nothing on it, making it clear.
- Block b is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block c is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block a.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block B positioned on top of block C and block D positioned on top of block B. This configuration involves stacking block B onto block C and then stacking block D onto block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration and valid actions indicate that I can either put down block A or stack it on blocks B or D. The goal requires block D to be free to stack on block B, which is already correctly positioned on block C.

Think: To work towards the goal state, block D needs to be stacked on block B, and currently, nothing is on block D, making it clear and ready for stacking. Block A needs to be put down to keep D clear for the next moves, and placing A on the table will maintain the current clarity of other blocks.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand and a table. The robot hand is currently empty. Blocks A, C, and D are located directly on the table. Block B is positioned on top of Block C. Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block B positioned on top of block C and block D positioned on top of block B. This configuration involves stacking block B onto block C and then stacking block D onto block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current valid actions suggest that I can manipulate blocks A and D by picking them up or adjust the position of block B by unstacking it from C. However, the goal is already met for block B being on top of C, so unstacking B from C would be counterproductive.

Think: To achieve the goal state, we need block D to be stacked on block B. Since the robot hand is empty, the next logical step is to pick up block D (since it is clear) so that it can be prepared for stacking on block B.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocks World environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Currently, block B is placed on top of block C, and both blocks A and C are on the table. Block D is being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, blocks A and B are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block B positioned on top of block C and block D positioned on top of block B. This configuration involves stacking block B onto block C and then stacking block D onto block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block D, and the goal is to stack D on top of B, which is already correctly positioned on C. The valid actions include the option to stack D on B, which directly aligns with the goal state requirements.

Think: Since the goal seeks to have D stacked on B, and this action is allowed in the current valid actions, I should proceed with stacking D onto B. This will achieve the final configuration of the blocks as desired in the goal state.

Action: stack(d:default,b:default)
