ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table. Block B is on top of Block D. The top surfaces of Blocks A, B, and C are clear, indicating that there are no other blocks stacked on them. This setup provides a clear visual of the starting configuration in the Blocksworld scenario, with the robot ready to manipulate these blocks as necessary.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block C. The environment includes a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The robot can pick up a block, put it down, stack one block on top of another, or unstack them. The current objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is directly above block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given that the robot's hand is empty and block B is currently on top of block D, the only way to manipulate block D is first to remove block B.
Think: To proceed toward the goal, block B must be moved away from block D. The valid action available to achieve this is to unstack B from D. Once block B is unstacked and the robot's hand is holding B, the next actions can be considered to place D on C.
Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block A is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block C is on the table and is clear, indicating nothing is on top of it.
- Block D is also on the table and is clear, with no blocks on top.

This setup indicates that all blocks except for Block B are resting on the table without any blocks stacked on them, and the robot's hand is occupied with holding Block B.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block C. The environment includes a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The robot can pick up a block, put it down, stack one block on top of another, or unstack them. The current objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is directly above block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Now that block B is in the robot's hand, the next step involves deciding where to place block B to facilitate the stacking of block D onto block C.
Think: Since the goal is to stack D on C, and both blocks C and D are clear and on the table, it's advantageous to put down block B in a location that does not interfere with future operations involving blocks C and D. The best option is to put block B down back on the table, as it keeps block C clear for the upcoming operation.
Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is currently positioned on the table. Additionally, all the blocks are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block C. The environment includes a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The robot can pick up a block, put it down, stack one block on top of another, or unstack them. The current objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is directly above block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot's hand now empty and all blocks clear on the table, I can directly manipulate block D, which is necessary to achieve the goal of stacking it on block C.
Think: The immediate action required is to pick up block D, since the goal is to stack it on top of block C. After picking up block D, the subsequent action in the next step would be to stack it on C.
Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks A, B, and C are positioned on the table, and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block D.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block C. The environment includes a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The robot can pick up a block, put it down, stack one block on top of another, or unstack them. The current objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is directly above block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is now holding block D, which is the essential step towards achieving the goal of placing it on block C.
Think: With block D in hand and block C clear and on the table, the direct action to achieve the goal is to stack D on C. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state.
Action: stack(d:default,c:default)
