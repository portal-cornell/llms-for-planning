ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a table and four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The setup of these blocks is as follows:
- Block 'd' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'a' itself is clear.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'd'.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment involves manipulating blocks where the robot can perform actions such as picking up and stacking. The robot's hand is currently empty, and it can pick up 'b' or unstack 'a' from 'c'. 

Think: To achieve the goal where block 'B' is on top of block 'D', and block 'D' is directly on top of block 'C', the current setup needs to be rearranged. Since block 'C' is already on top of block 'D', and we need block 'B' to be on top of block 'D', a good initial action is to pick up block 'B' since it is clear and the action is allowed. This will enable us to stack 'B' onto 'D' in subsequent steps.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block D is on the table.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- The robot hand is holding Block B.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear, meaning nothing is placed on top of it.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand's activity.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'B', and the goal is to have block 'B' on top of block 'D' which is directly on top of block 'C'. The valid actions provided are to either put down 'B' or stack 'B' on top of 'A'. However, stacking 'B' on 'A' does not directly contribute to achieving the goal configuration.

Think: Since block 'D' is under block 'C', and our goal is to stack block 'B' on top of block 'D', none of the current valid actions directly achieve this. Placing 'B' down does not progress towards the goal either. However, it might be necessary to perform the available action and adjust the strategy depending on the next set of valid actions. For now, putting down 'B' seems to be the only action that does not conflict with the goal, as stacking 'B' on 'A' would be counterproductive.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a table and four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The setup of these blocks is as follows:
- Block 'd' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'a' itself is clear.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'd'.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Previously, moving block 'B' was necessary to reach the goal state where block 'B' needs to be stacked on block 'D'. The robot hand is currently empty, and we are back to the situation where picking up block 'B' is available, along with unstacking block 'A' from 'C'.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration where block 'B' is on top of block 'D', and block 'D' is directly on top of block 'C', we must first pick up block 'B'. This action will prepare us to stack it onto block 'D' in future steps, assuming the valid actions will allow for this in the next state. Since block 'C' is already correctly on top of block 'D', no action is needed with block 'A' at this moment.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block D is on the table.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- The robot hand is holding Block B.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear, meaning nothing is placed on top of it.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand's activity.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is still holding block 'B', and my previous action to pick up block 'B' was to prepare for stacking it on block 'D'. However, the current valid actions do not include stacking 'B' directly on 'D'. Instead, options are to put down 'B' or stack it on 'A'.

Think: The ultimate goal is to stack block 'B' on top of block 'D'. Currently, block 'D' is occupied by block 'C', and the only actions available do not directly help in achieving the goal setup. The action of putting down 'B' will return it to a neutral position without advancing the goal, but it might be necessary to refresh the valid actions, potentially allowing a more beneficial move in the next step. Stacking 'B' on 'A' is not in line with the goal and would further complicate achieving the desired configuration.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a table and four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The setup of these blocks is as follows:
- Block 'd' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'a' itself is clear.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'd'.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: I am back to a similar state where the robot's hand is empty, and the blocks are in their initial positions. The action of putting down 'B' previously has returned the scenario to an earlier point without advancing towards the goal. 

Think: The goal is to stack block 'B' on top of block 'D', which is on top of block 'C'. Block 'B' is clear and can be picked up. Picking up block 'B' is a necessary step before it can be stacked on block 'D', which aligns with the goal. The current valid actions allow for this move, and it is the most straightforward action that moves towards achieving the goal.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block D is on the table.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- The robot hand is holding Block B.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear, meaning nothing is placed on top of it.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand's activity.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Once again, the robot hand is holding block 'B', and the available actions don't directly contribute to achieving the goal, which is to stack 'B' on 'D'. However, block 'D' is underneath 'C', preventing the direct stacking of 'B' on 'D'.

Think: To progress towards the goal, block 'B' needs to be stacked on block 'D'. Given that the current valid actions do not directly support this move, we need to manipulate the environment to refresh the options potentially. Putting down 'B' keeps it clear for future manipulation, while stacking it on 'A' does not align with achieving the goal. Therefore, putting down 'B' seems the most neutral action that maintains flexibility for future moves.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a table and four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The setup of these blocks is as follows:
- Block 'd' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'a' itself is clear.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'd'.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty again, and we're back to a situation where block 'B' can be picked up. The last few actions have not progressed towards the goal, as block 'B' needs to be stacked on 'D' while 'D' is underneath 'C'.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, block 'B' needs to be stacked on block 'D'. Currently, block 'D' is occupied by block 'C', which makes it unavailable for stacking 'B' directly. The robot hand being empty and given the valid actions, picking up block 'B' is a necessary step. This action will prepare us to stack it onto block 'D' in future steps, assuming the valid actions will allow for this in the subsequent state.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block D is on the table.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- The robot hand is holding Block B.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear, meaning nothing is placed on top of it.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand's activity.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The situation remains where the robot hand is holding block 'B', and the goal is to stack 'B' on 'D'. However, block 'D' is currently occupied by block 'C', making it impossible to stack 'B' directly on 'D' as desired.

Think: The current actions available are either to put down block 'B' or to stack it on block 'A'. Since stacking 'B' on 'A' does not advance toward the goal and may complicate future moves, it's prudent to put 'B' down. This action will keep the robot's hand free and might change the valid actions in the next step, potentially allowing a move that progresses towards the goal.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a table and four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The setup of these blocks is as follows:
- Block 'd' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'a' itself is clear.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'd'.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Repeatedly, we find ourselves in this starting condition with the robot hand empty and block 'B' clear and on the table. Previous actions have not moved closer to the goal of stacking 'B' on 'D', with 'D' on 'C'.

Think: Given the goal and the current state, the most direct path forward involves manipulating blocks 'B', 'C', and 'D' to achieve the desired configuration. Since 'D' is underneath 'C', and we need 'B' on top of 'D', we need to consider an action that might open up new possibilities. Picking up block 'B' again seems redundant without subsequent new actions being available that align with the goal. Unstacking 'A' from 'C' might not directly contribute to stacking 'B' on 'D', but it could potentially alter the set of valid actions in the next state, allowing for a new strategy.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, which involves a collection of blocks and a robot hand, the state of the blocks and the robot hand can be described as follows:

- Block 'c' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it, and it is placed on top of block 'd'.
- Block 'b' is also clear and is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'.
- Block 'd' is on the table and has block 'c' on top of it.

This setup involves four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', with various configurations of placement either on the table or on top of another block, and interactions with the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'A', which was previously unstacked from block 'C'. The goal requires stacking block 'B' on top of block 'D', with block 'D' already correctly positioned on top of block 'C'. 

Think: The current valid actions do not directly advance towards the goal since they involve block 'A', which is not part of the final configuration required. However, placing 'A' in a position where it does not interfere with future necessary moves is strategic. Stacking 'A' back on 'C' could revert to a previous state, and stacking it on 'B' is not aligned with the goal. The best option is to put down 'A' to free up the robot hand and possibly open up future actions that will allow manipulation of block 'B' to place it on 'D'.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocks World scenario, we have four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, and a robot's hand involved in manipulating these blocks. The current state of the blocks is as follows:

- Block A is clear (nothing is on top of it) and it is placed on the table.
- Block B is also clear and on the table.
- Block C is clear but is placed on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty and all blocks except 'C' are clear and not interfering with each other. Block 'C' is on top of block 'D', which is part of the desired goal configuration, but 'B' needs to be stacked on 'D'.

Think: The goal is to have block 'B' on top of 'D' with 'D' directly on top of 'C'. Currently, 'B' is clear and can be picked up to eventually be stacked on 'D'. Picking up 'B' is a necessary step towards achieving the goal. The action to unstack 'C' from 'D' would disrupt the partial goal configuration of 'D' being under 'C', so it should be avoided.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their statuses:

1. Block a is clear and placed on the table.
2. Block b is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block c is clear and placed on top of block d.
4. Block d is positioned on the table.

This setup describes the initial or current state of the block world where the robot can manipulate the blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'B', which is crucial for achieving the goal. The goal requires block 'B' to be stacked on top of block 'D', which is already in the correct position underneath block 'C'.

Think: The valid actions include putting down 'B' or stacking it on either 'A' or 'C'. However, stacking 'B' on 'A' does not contribute to the goal. The desired action is to stack 'B' directly on 'D', but this option is currently not available directly. Since block 'D' is under 'C' and we want 'B' on 'D', stacking 'B' on 'C' would place it adjacent to 'D' and might lead to options in future steps that allow rearranging to the final goal state.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

1. Block A is situated directly on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is placed on top of Block C, and it is also clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
3. Block C is on top of Block D, connecting these two blocks vertically.
4. Block D is directly on the table, supporting Block C above it.
5. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.

This setup forms a vertical stack from D at the base, followed by C, and then B at the top. Block A is separate and directly on the table. The goal in this scenario would typically involve rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state now has block 'B' stacked on top of 'C', which is on top of 'D', forming a vertical line. The robot hand is empty. The goal is very close, requiring block 'B' to be directly on 'D' with 'D' on 'C'.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration where block 'B' is directly on block 'D', the current obstacle is that block 'C' is between them. The action to unstack 'B' from 'C' is available and necessary. This will free block 'B' to be potentially restacked directly on 'D' in a future action, aligning with the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their statuses:

1. Block a is clear and placed on the table.
2. Block b is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block c is clear and placed on top of block d.
4. Block d is positioned on the table.

This setup describes the initial or current state of the block world where the robot can manipulate the blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'B', which is necessary for achieving the goal. The goal is to stack block 'B' on top of block 'D', while block 'D' remains directly on top of block 'C'. Currently, block 'D' is in the correct position underneath block 'C'.

Think: The valid actions include putting down 'B' or stacking it on either 'A' or 'C'. Stacking 'B' on 'A' does not align with the goal. The most effective action towards the goal is to stack 'B' directly on 'D'. However, since block 'C' is currently on 'D', stacking 'B' on 'C' aligns 'B' closer to 'D' and may facilitate future moves to rearrange 'C' and achieve the goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

1. Block A is situated directly on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is placed on top of Block C, and it is also clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
3. Block C is on top of Block D, connecting these two blocks vertically.
4. Block D is directly on the table, supporting Block C above it.
5. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.

This setup forms a vertical stack from D at the base, followed by C, and then B at the top. Block A is separate and directly on the table. The goal in this scenario would typically involve rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has block 'B' stacked on top of 'C', which is on top of 'D'. The robot hand is empty. The goal is to have block 'B' directly on block 'D' with 'D' on 'C', which means block 'C' needs to be repositioned or removed from between 'B' and 'D'.

Think: To align with the goal, the necessary step is to remove block 'B' from on top of 'C', freeing it to be potentially repositioned directly on 'D' in subsequent actions. The valid action available that moves us toward this configuration is to unstack block 'B' from 'C'. This will place 'B' in the robot hand, ready for a subsequent action to stack it correctly according to the goal.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their statuses:

1. Block a is clear and placed on the table.
2. Block b is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block c is clear and placed on top of block d.
4. Block d is positioned on the table.

This setup describes the initial or current state of the block world where the robot can manipulate the blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We are now back to the state where the robot hand is holding block 'B'. The goal requires block 'B' to be on top of block 'D', while block 'D' is directly on top of block 'C'. Currently, block 'C' is correctly positioned on 'D', aligning with part of the goal state.

Think: The optimal action to progress towards the goal is to stack block 'B' directly on block 'D'. However, the valid actions do not include directly stacking 'B' on 'D'. Stacking 'B' on 'C', given that 'C' is on 'D', would place 'B' adjacent to 'D', aligning it closer to the desired final configuration. This action could potentially lead to achieving the goal if subsequent actions allow further adjustment.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

1. Block A is situated directly on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is placed on top of Block C, and it is also clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
3. Block C is on top of Block D, connecting these two blocks vertically.
4. Block D is directly on the table, supporting Block C above it.
5. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.

This setup forms a vertical stack from D at the base, followed by C, and then B at the top. Block A is separate and directly on the table. The goal in this scenario would typically involve rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state presents block 'B' stacked above 'C', which is on top of block 'D'. The desired goal is to have block 'B' directly on block 'D', with block 'D' beneath block 'C'. The robot hand is empty, which allows for manipulation of the blocks.

Think: To realign the blocks to meet the goal state, block 'B' needs to be removed from on top of 'C' so it can be subsequently placed on 'D'. The valid action to unstack 'B' from 'C' is available and is a crucial step toward repositioning 'B' in accordance with the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their statuses:

1. Block a is clear and placed on the table.
2. Block b is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block c is clear and placed on top of block d.
4. Block d is positioned on the table.

This setup describes the initial or current state of the block world where the robot can manipulate the blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block 'B', which is essential to achieve the goal. The goal requires block 'B' to be stacked on block 'D', while 'D' is directly on top of block 'C'. Currently, 'C' is already appropriately on 'D'.

Think: To move toward the goal, stacking 'B' directly on 'D' would be ideal, but the valid actions do not currently allow for this. The provided options are to put down 'B' or to stack it on 'A' or 'C'. Stacking 'B' on 'C' aligns 'B' directly above 'D', creating a vertical arrangement from 'D' to 'C' to 'B'. This configuration meets the goal criteria with 'B' on top of 'D' and 'D' directly on top of 'C'.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

1. Block A is situated directly on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is placed on top of Block C, and it is also clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
3. Block C is on top of Block D, connecting these two blocks vertically.
4. Block D is directly on the table, supporting Block C above it.
5. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.

This setup forms a vertical stack from D at the base, followed by C, and then B at the top. Block A is separate and directly on the table. The goal in this scenario would typically involve rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves block 'B' being stacked on top of block 'C', which is on top of block 'D'. The goal is for block 'B' to be directly on top of block 'D', with 'D' directly on top of 'C'. The robot hand is empty, allowing for manipulation.

Think: To achieve the goal, block 'B' needs to be directly on block 'D'. Currently, 'B' is on 'C', which is on 'D'. The action to unstack 'B' from 'C' will free 'B', making it available to be repositioned directly on 'D' in a subsequent step. This action is necessary to move closer to the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their statuses:

1. Block a is clear and placed on the table.
2. Block b is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block c is clear and placed on top of block d.
4. Block d is positioned on the table.

This setup describes the initial or current state of the block world where the robot can manipulate the blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block 'B', and the goal is to have block 'B' on top of block 'D', with block 'D' directly on top of block 'C'. Currently, block 'C' is in the correct position on top of block 'D'.

Think: The immediate step towards achieving the goal is to place 'B' on 'D'. However, the valid actions do not include stacking 'B' directly on 'D'. The action to stack 'B' on 'C' would place 'B' adjacent in the stack above 'D', which aligns with the goal of having 'B' close to 'D'. This action places 'B' in the correct vertical alignment with 'D' and 'C', potentially allowing for future actions to achieve the exact goal configuration.
