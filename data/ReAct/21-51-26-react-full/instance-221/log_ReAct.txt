ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

1. Block a is clear and situated on top of block d.
2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: No error feedback was given, so the previous action or understanding of the environment seems accurate. We need to maneuver blocks to achieve a configuration where B is on top of D, C on top of B, and D on top of A.

Think: The current actionable choices involve either picking up block b or unstacking block a from d. Since block b is already clear and on the table, picking it up won't immediately contribute to achieving the goal state. Instead, unstacking block a from d aligns with our need to later reposition block d (as per the goal for D to be on top of A). After unstacking, block a will be in the robot's hand, and block d will become clear and ready for further manipulation.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: No error feedback was given, so the previous action of unstacking block A from block D was successful. The robot now holds block A, and block D is clear, which is a step closer to achieving the desired goal configuration.

Think: Considering the goal state, ultimately we want block D to be on top of block A. Since block A is currently held by the robot and block D is clear, stacking block A on block D right now aligns perfectly with the goal state requirements. This action also keeps block B and block C clear and on the table, which will allow for future maneuvers to stack B on D and C on B as required by the goal state.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

1. Block a is clear and situated on top of block d.
2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This appears to be the same state and available actions as described in the first interaction. In that instance, we chose to unstack block a from block d, which was a step towards the goal state configuration.

Think: Since the robot's hand is empty and block b is clear and directly on the table, picking up block b is a straightforward choice. However, it won't directly help us in achieving the goal configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C on top of block B, and block D on top of block A. Instead, repeating the action of unstacking block a from block d will move us closer to the goal by making block d clear, which is needed to eventually place it on block a according to the goal state.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot currently holds block A, and block D is clear and not under any other block, as previously unstacked. This is a continuation of our strategy to align with the goal state configuration.

Think: Given that the goal state requires block D to be on top of block A, the immediate action of stacking block A on block D is the most strategic move. It aligns block A and D as required in the goal state, setting the foundation for subsequent moves to stack B on D and C on B.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

1. Block a is clear and situated on top of block d.
2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It seems that there has been a reset or repetition in the scenario description, as this matches the first setup we encountered. Previously, the action chosen was to unstack a from d, which successfully moved us towards the goal configuration.

Think: Continuing with the effective strategy from the initial interaction, unstacking block a from block d is the appropriate action. This leaves block d clear and ready for further manipulation, specifically to eventually stack it on block a as required by the goal state. Since block b is clear and on the table, and the robot's hand is empty, picking up block b does not immediately contribute to achieving the goal state configuration.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We are at a critical junction where the robot is holding block A and block D is clear. This setup aligns with our strategy to stack block A on block D to match part of the goal configuration.

Think: Given that the goal requires block D to be on top of block A, the action to stack block A on block D is the most prudent choice. This action will place block A exactly where it needs to be in relation to block D according to the goal state, facilitating the subsequent steps needed to arrange the other blocks accordingly.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

1. Block a is clear and situated on top of block d.
2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The state and valid actions are the same as previously encountered. In this situation, unstacking block a from block d has been the strategic choice to progress toward the goal state.

Think: The action to unstack block a from block d will make block d clear, which is necessary for later actions involving block d, specifically to eventually have block D on top of block A. Since the robot's hand is empty, this action will also place block a in the robot's hand, allowing for future manipulation. Picking up block b is not immediately beneficial for progressing towards the goal state structure.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot is holding block A, and block D is clear and positioned on top of block C. This situation aligns with a previous scenario where the next strategic step was to stack block A on block D to align with the goal state configuration.

Think: Given that the goal requires block D to be on top of block A, stacking block A on block D is the appropriate action. This will place block A in the desired position relative to block D, supporting the objective of the goal state. After this action, we can focus on arranging the other blocks (B and C) accordingly.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The scenario has repeated with the same configuration and available actions as seen in prior interactions. Based on previous decisions, the action of unstacking block a from block d has been effective in progressing toward the goal state.

Think: To continue towards the goal configuration, unstacking block a from block d is the most strategic move. This action will make block d clear, facilitating its eventual placement on top of block a, which is aligned with the goal state requirements. The robot's hand will hold block a after this action, keeping it ready for future rearrangements.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We are at a familiar point where the robot is holding block A, and block D is clear, which aligns with previous steps taken towards achieving the goal configuration.

Think: Given the goal structure that requires block D to be on top of block A, stacking block A on block D is the immediate necessary action. This places block A and D in the correct relationship as stipulated in the goal state. This step is crucial for setting up the subsequent arrangement of blocks B and C.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

1. Block a is clear and situated on top of block d.
2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We are revisiting the same initial setup and valid actions as in previous interactions. The strategic decision to unstack block a from block d remains pivotal in moving closer to the goal, as it creates an opportunity to rearrange block d appropriately later.

Think: The action of unstacking block a from block d is again the most beneficial. This will make block d clear, setting the stage for it to be placed on top of block a as required in the goal state. With the robot's hand empty, unstacking block a is feasible and aligns with our goal to correctly position the blocks.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We are at a recurrent point in the scenario where the robot holds block A, and block D is clear and available. This situation has been addressed previously by stacking block A on block D to progress towards the goal configuration.

Think: Considering the goal state, where block D should be on top of block A, the correct move is to stack block A on block D. This action directly places block A in its required position relative to block D, aligning with the ultimate configuration sought in the goal state. Following this, we can then focus on arranging blocks B and C accordingly.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

1. Block a is clear and situated on top of block d.
2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Once again, we are presented with the initial setup and similar valid actions as in previous rounds. The consistent and effective strategy has been to unstack block a from block d, which aligns with our steps towards achieving the goal state.

Think: By unstacking block a from block d, we prepare block d to later be maneuvered into a position on top of block a, which is required by the goal state. The robot's hand being empty allows for this action, and it is a direct step towards reconfiguring the blocks as needed. Picking up block b does not contribute directly to the goal at this stage.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In this recurring scenario, the robot is holding block A, and block D is clear. The goal configuration requires block D to be on top of block A. As seen in previous iterations, stacking block A on block D has been the strategic choice to align with the goal.

Think: Given that block D is clear and block A is in the robot's hand, stacking block A on block D is the most appropriate action. This move not only aligns with the goal configuration but also sets up the next steps for positioning blocks B and C. 

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current setup:

1. Block a is clear and situated on top of block d.
2. Block b is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block c is also directly on the table.
4. Block d is on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This configuration requires careful maneuvering of blocks to achieve any desired rearrangement using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking while adhering to the constraints of only moving clear blocks and maintaining an empty hand for picking up new blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This setting is identical to previous instances where the initial decision was to unstack block a from block d. This action has been consistently aligned with moving towards the required goal configuration.

Think: Unstacking block a from block d remains the strategic action. It will make block d clear, which is necessary to eventually place it on top of block a, as specified in the goal state. Since block b being picked up does not immediately contribute towards the goal configuration, it is prudent to continue with the unstacking action.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We are again at the point where the robot is holding block A, and block D is clear. The goal state requires block D to be on top of block A, which aligns with the decision made in previous interactions.

Think: Stacking block A on block D is the immediate and strategic action necessary for achieving the goal configuration. This move places block A and block D in their correct relative positions as required by the goal state. This action not only aligns with the goal but also sets up the potential to arrange blocks B and C subsequently.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial setup is repeated, and the strategic decision in previous interactions was to unstack block a from block d. This action has consistently aligned with the steps toward achieving the goal state configuration.

Think: Continuing with the effective strategy, unstacking block a from block d is the most beneficial action. It makes block d clear, which is necessary for the eventual placement of block d on top of block a, as required by the goal state. The robot's hand being empty allows for this action, and it is a direct step towards reconfiguring the blocks as needed. Picking up block b does not contribute directly to the goal at this stage.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The scenario repeats with the robot holding block A and block D being clear. In previous interactions, the strategic move has been to stack block A on block D, aligning with part of the required goal state configuration.

Think: Given that the goal requires block D to be on top of block A, stacking block A on block D is the appropriate action. This move places block A in its required position relative to block D, facilitating the next steps for arranging blocks B and C as specified in the goal state.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This initial setup with the blocks and the available actions, including unstacking block a from block d, has been presented multiple times. Unstacking block a from block d has been a consistent and strategic move towards the goal configuration.

Think: Continuing with the effective strategy, unstacking block a from block d remains the most beneficial action at this stage. It not only makes block d clear, which is necessary for later maneuvering it atop block a as required by the goal state, but it also ensures the robot's hand is utilized efficiently by holding block a, ready for future rearrangement actions. Picking up block b, while it is a valid action, does not directly contribute to achieving the goal state at this moment.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table, and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block D is also clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block C is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block C.

This setup involves blocks being either on the table or stacked upon each other, with the robot currently holding one of the blocks. The goal would involve rearranging these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration will achieve the desired stacking order of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We're at a familiar point where the robot is holding block A, and block D is clear. The goal configuration necessitates that block D be on top of block A. Previous decisions have consistently involved stacking block A on block D to progress toward the goal.

Think: Given that the goal requires block D to be on top of block A, the action to stack block A on block D is crucial. This aligns block A directly under block D as required by the goal state, setting a foundational element of the desired block arrangement. This action is strategic as it directly contributes to achieving the goal configuration.
