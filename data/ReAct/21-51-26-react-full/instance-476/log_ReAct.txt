ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the current state involves several blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a robot hand. Here is a summary of the configuration and status of each component:

1. The robot hand is currently empty.
2. Blocks A and E are directly on the table.
3. Block B is placed on top of Block E.
4. Block D is stacked on top of Block A.
5. Block C is on top of Block D.
6. Blocks B and C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This setup forms a couple of towers of blocks and some individual blocks on the table, with the robot hand ready to manipulate these blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current valid actions suggest that the robot hand can only unstack two specific pairs of blocks at this moment. This indicates that at each step, the available actions are constrained by the current configuration of blocks and whether the robot hand is empty or holding a block.

Think: To move towards the goal state, I need to rearrange the blocks as described. The goal requires block C to be on top of block A, and since C is currently on top of D, the first logical action is to unstack C from D. This will make C available to later place on A as required. The robot hand is currently empty, which is suitable for performing an unstack action.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block E is also on the table.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block E and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block A and is also clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block C. 

This setup forms part of a scenario where the goal is typically to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration using the robot's actions.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand currently holding block C provides opportunities to either put it down or stack it on top of another block. The valid actions indicate that blocks B and D are potential candidates for stacking with block C. Given the goal, however, C needs to be placed on A to contribute to the desired configuration.

Think: Since C needs to eventually be on top of A and is currently in the robotâ€™s hand, placing C on the table might be a good intermediate step. This action will keep C available for later placement directly on A once A is properly positioned (currently, A is on the table and not yet under E as required by the goal state). None of the current valid stacking actions align C directly with the goal configuration. Therefore, putting C down is the best move to maintain flexibility for future moves that will more directly contribute to achieving the goal.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The blocks are positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block E, and Block B is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block A and it is clear.
- Block E is also on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any block. This setup provides various options for the robot to manipulate the blocks, such as picking up the clear blocks (B, C, D) or moving blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the valid actions and the current configuration of the blocks, the robot can either pick up block C or unstack blocks B from E and D from A. To work towards the goal configuration, adjustments in the layout of the base blocks, particularly A and E, are necessary since they need to support other blocks per the goal state.

Think: The ultimate goal requires block E to be underneath block D, and for that configuration, block B needs to be displaced from atop E. Unstacking block B from E will make E available to be moved or for other blocks to be stacked upon it. Since the robot hand is empty, this action is immediately executable and aligns with the necessary steps towards rearranging the blocks according to the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The robot hand is currently holding block b. Blocks a, c, and e are directly on the table. Block d is positioned on top of block a. Blocks c, d, and e are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and the goal state requires block D to be on top of block B. Therefore, placing block B in a position where block D can later be stacked on it is a critical next step towards achieving the goal configuration.

Think: Given the goal structure, block E needs to be at the base of one of the stacks, and block D needs to be on top of block B. The current valid actions include stacking block B on C, D, or E. To align with the goal state, positioning block B on block E is the optimal choice, as this will facilitate the subsequent stacking of block D on block B, moving closer to the desired configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,e:default)

The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the available actions involve either picking up block C or unstacking blocks B from E and D from A. To achieve the goal configuration, some foundational changes need to be made, specifically involving blocks A and E as they form the base for other blocks in the goal state.

Think: The goal requires block E to eventually be at the base of a stack supporting block D, and then block B, meaning block E should be clear. Currently, block B is on top of block E, which is not aligned with the goal. Unstacking block B from E will clear block E for future moves. This action aligns with the steps needed to reconfigure block E to support block D, as required in the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The robot hand is currently holding block b. Blocks a, c, and e are directly on the table. Block d is positioned on top of block a. Blocks c, d, and e are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal state requires block D to be on top of block B. Setting block B in a position where it can later support block D is crucial.

Think: Given the goal structure, block E needs to be at the base of one of the stacks, and block D needs to be on top of block B. Among the valid actions, stacking block B on block E aligns with the goal, as this would allow block E to be positioned ultimately beneath block D, which in turn would be stacked above block B. This configuration is a step towards the desired final arrangement of the blocks.

Action: stack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The blocks are positioned as follows:

- Block A is on the table.

- Block C is on the table and it is clear.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block A and it is clear.
- Block E is also on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any block. This setup provides various options for the robot to manipulate the blocks, such as picking up the clear blocks (B, C, D) or moving blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and the valid actions involve picking up block C or unstacking blocks B from E and D from A. To align closer to the goal state, where block E needs to be at the base of the stack supporting D, and subsequently B, rearranging block E's position is essential.

Think: According to the goal state, block E should eventually support block D. Currently, block E is under block B, which is not ideal for the final configuration. Unstacking block B from E will free up block E to be moved or rearranged to eventually support block D. As the robot hand is empty, this action can be executed immediately and is a strategic move towards achieving the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(b:default,e:default)

- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, which needs to be positioned underneath block D according to the goal state. The valid actions suggest potential placements for block B, including on top of blocks C, D, or E.

Think: To align with the goal configuration, block E ultimately needs to be at the base of a stack that supports block D, which in turn supports block B. The valid action that aligns with this goal is to stack block B on top of block E. This setup will facilitate the subsequent placement of block D on top of block B, moving closer to achieving the goal state configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,e:default)

- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the current valid actions allow for the manipulation of blocks B, C, and D. Considering the goal structure and the placement of blocks right now, it's important to adjust the positions of the fundamental base blocks, specifically A and E, to progress towards the goal.

Think: The final goal requires block E to be underneath block D, and for block A to be on top of block E. Currently, block B is on top of block E, which is not aligned with the goal. To move towards this goal configuration, unstacking block B from E will free block E, allowing for future steps to rearrange it to support block D, as required in the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The robot hand is currently holding block b. Blocks a, c, and e are directly on the table. Block d is positioned on top of block a. Blocks c, d, and e are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand holding block B and considering the goal state, placing block B in a position where it can later support block D, which is part of the goal, is essential. The valid actions provide options for stacking block B on other blocks, which must be evaluated for their utility towards achieving the goal state.

Think: The goal requires block E to be the base for block D, and then block B must be on top of block E. Given that block B is currently in the robot hand and considering the final arrangement, stacking block B on block E seems to be the most strategic move. This will allow block D eventually to be stacked on top of block B, aligning with the goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the valid actions indicate possibilities to manipulate blocks C, B, and D. Considering the goal is to reconfigure the blocks so that block E becomes the foundation for a stack culminating in block D, adjusting the positions of blocks E and A is critical.

Think: Currently, block B is on top of block E, which does not align with the goal state. To move towards the goal where block E supports block D, block B needs to be removed from block E. Unstacking block B from E will free up block E, allowing it to be repositioned or prepared for future stacking, specifically to support block D as needed in the goal state.

- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and the goal state requires that block D be stacked on top of block B. Therefore, positioning block B correctly is crucial at this stage. The valid actions include putting down block B or stacking it on blocks C, D, or E.

Think: Given the goal configuration, block E needs to be at the base of the stack that will ultimately have block D on top of block B. Thus, stacking block B on block E aligns with the desired end state, as it sets the stage for block D to be placed on top of block B, which is on top of block E, forming part of the required configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,e:default)

- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the valid actions available are to pick up block C or unstack blocks B from E and D from A. Since the goal state requires a specific configuration where block E needs to eventually support block D, and block A has to be on top of block E, reorganization of these base blocks is crucial.

Think: To proceed towards the goal configuration, block E should be prepared to support block D. Currently, block B is stacked on top of block E, which is not aligned with the goal state. Unstacking block B from E will clear block E, allowing for future rearrangement necessary to place block D on top of it, as required by the goal configuration. Since the robot's hand is empty, unstacking is immediately actionable.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand is holding block B, and there are several options for stacking it on other blocks. The goal state requires that block D is on top of block B and block E is at the base of this particular stack.

Think: To align with the goal, block B needs to be positioned so that it can support block D. Stacking block B on block E is the most strategic move currently available. This action positions block E to eventually support block D, which aligns with the goal state where block E is at the base, topped by block D, and then block B.

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the current valid actions involve picking up block C or unstacking blocks B from E and D from A. Given the goal configuration, where block E needs to be at the base of a stack that culminates with block D, and block A also needs to be repositioned, strategic manipulation of these blocks is key.

Think: To proceed towards the goal configuration, block E should eventually support block D. Since block B is currently on top of block E and not needed there per the goal state, unstacking block B from E will clear block E, allowing it to be rearranged as necessary. This action aligns with the steps needed to reconfigure block E to support block D as required in the goal state.

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the valid actions provide options to either pick up block C or unstack blocks B from E and D from A. Considering the goal configuration, strategic manipulation of the base blocks, particularly blocks A and E, is crucial.

Think: The goal state requires block E to eventually be at the base of a stack that supports block D, and block A needs to be placed on top of block E. Currently, block B is on top of block E, which does not align with the goal state. Unstacking block B from E will free block E, allowing for future steps to rearrange it to support block D as required in the goal state. Therefore, unstacking block B from E is a strategic move towards achieving the goal.

Action: unstack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The robot hand is currently holding block b. Blocks a, c, and e are directly on the table. Block d is positioned on top of block a. Blocks c, d, and e are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block B, and block E is on top of block D. This setup will create a specific configuration of blocks stacked upon each other.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand holding block B, the objective is to place block B in a position that aligns with the goal configuration, where block D needs to be on top of block B. The valid actions include options to stack block B on top of blocks C, D, or E.

Think: According to the goal, block E should eventually be under block D, which should be on top of block B. Therefore, positioning block B on block E is a strategic move. This sets up block E to later support block D, which will be on top of block B, creating part of the desired final structure.
