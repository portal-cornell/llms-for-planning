ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table. The configuration of the blocks is as follows:
- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block E.
- Block E is on top of Block C.
- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. This setup requires careful planning for the robot to rearrange the blocks if needed, ensuring the hand is used efficiently to move blocks either from the table or from other blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that the robot hand is empty, and there is only one valid action available, which is to unstack block A from block E. Given that the goal is to rearrange block C directly on top of block D, which is on top of block E, we need to first clear the path by removing block A.

Think: Since the robot hand is empty and the only action available is to unstack block A from block E, performing this action is necessary to move forward. By unstacking block A, we will be able to access block E and eventually reconfigure the blocks to achieve the goal state. After unstacking, block A will be in the robot's hand, and further actions can be considered based on the new state of the environment.

Action: unstack(a:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here's the current configuration:

- Block c is on top of block b.
- Block e is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
- Block d is on the table, which implies it's directly placed on the table without any blocks underneath.
- The robot hand is currently holding block a.
- Block e is on top of block c.
- Block b is on top of block d.

This setup involves various blocks either being stacked on each other or placed directly on the table, with one block being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block A, and the goal involves reconfiguring blocks C, D, and E. Currently, block E is clear and on top of block C, but block C needs to be on top of block D, and D on top of E, according to the goal state. The valid actions involve either putting down block A or stacking it on block E.

Think: To move towards the goal state, it is essential to free up block C and rearrange it with blocks D and E. Since block E is clear and already on top of C, stacking block A on E would only complicate reaching the goal because it would then require additional moves to clear block E again. Therefore, the most straightforward action to aid in the future reconfiguration of blocks C, D, and E is to put down block A on the table. This will keep the environment less cluttered and the robot hand free to manipulate the key blocks involved in achieving the goal state.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block a is on the table and clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
- Block b is placed on top of block d.
- Block c has block e on top of it, and it is not clear.
- Block d is on the table.
- Block e, being on top of block c, is clear.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks are variously stacked and placed, with the robot hand available to perform actions such as moving blocks around to achieve desired configurations.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(e:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand is empty, and the configuration of the blocks does not match the goal state. To move towards the goal, the blocks need to be rearranged so that block C is on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. Block E is clear and on top of block C, but block C is not in the right position yet.

Think: Given the goal state and the current configuration, the immediate task should be to free up block C, which is currently underneath block E. The valid action to unstack block E from block C aligns with this requirement, as it will make block C clear and allow for subsequent repositioning of blocks D and E. Picking up block A does not directly contribute to achieving the goal state at this stage, as block A is not involved in the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(e:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The following conditions are observed:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A and Block D are directly on the table.
- Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is holding Block E.

This configuration needs to be considered by the agent to plan further actions effectively.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block E, and the goal is to arrange blocks C, D, and E in a specific configuration. Currently, blocks C and D are not correctly aligned with the goal, as C should be on D, and D should be on E. Block E, held by the robot, is crucial for achieving this configuration.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, block E needs to be positioned on block D. However, block D is currently under block B, and block C is clear. The best course of action would be to put down block E somewhere that does not conflict with the future repositioning of blocks C and D. Stacking E directly on C or A does not immediately help in achieving the goal configuration. Thus, putting down block E on the table will free up the robot's hand and keep the environment less cluttered, allowing more strategic moves like repositioning block D or C afterwards.

Action: put-down(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block c is on top of block b, and block c is clear.
2. Block b is on top of block d.
3. Block a is clear and is on the table.
4. Block e is clear and is also on the table.
5. Block d is on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. This setup indicates that blocks a, d, and e are directly on the table, while blocks c and b are stacked on other blocks, with c being at the top of its stack. The clarity of blocks a, c, and e indicates that there is no block on top of them, allowing for potential moves involving these blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the current state showing block C on top of block B and the robot hand empty, the configuration needs to be adjusted to meet the goal where block C is on D, and D on E. Since block E and block D are both on the table and clear, they are in positions where they can potentially be stacked upon. The robot hand being empty allows for picking up or unstacking blocks directly.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block C needs to be moved, but before placing it on block D, block D must be positioned on block E. Block E is currently on the table and clear, making it an ideal candidate to initiate the stacking process. By picking up block E, the robot can then proceed to stack D on E in subsequent moves, creating the base of the desired final configuration.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The following conditions are observed:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A and Block D are directly on the table.
- Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is holding Block E.

This configuration needs to be considered by the agent to plan further actions effectively.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block E. The goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on D and D on E. Presently, E is not in the correct position since it needs to be at the base of the stack involving blocks D and C.

Think: Since block E needs to be at the bottom of the stack with D on top of E and C on top of D, the current configuration requires repositioning E first to facilitate further moves. The immediate action should involve putting block E down on the table, making it available for stacking block D upon it later. This action simplifies the environment and prepares for the subsequent required action of stacking D on E.

Action: put-down(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block c is on top of block b, and block c is clear.
2. Block b is on top of block d.
3. Block a is clear and is on the table.
4. Block e is clear and is also on the table.
5. Block d is on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. This setup indicates that blocks a, d, and e are directly on the table, while blocks c and b are stacked on other blocks, with c being at the top of its stack. The clarity of blocks a, c, and e indicates that there is no block on top of them, allowing for potential moves involving these blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot's hand currently empty and blocks positioned such that block C is on top of B, and block D separately on the table, the configuration needs adjustment to meet the goal of having C on D and D on E. Since we need block D to be accessible for stacking on E, it's crucial to manage the stacks effectively.

Think: The first priority is to prepare block D for stacking on E, which is already clear and on the table. Since blocks B and C are stacked with C on top, unstacking C from B will make block C directly available for future stacking on D, once D is placed on E. Given the valid actions and the goal configuration, the optimal move is to use the unstack action to free block C, allowing more flexibility in later steps to manipulate D and E accordingly.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block a is on the table and clear (nothing is on top of it).
- Block b is stacked on top of block d and is clear.
- Block c is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is on the table, with block b on top of it.
- Block e is on the table and clear.

This setup forms the current state of the environment in the Blocksworld domain, where the robot can perform actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand is holding block C, which is a critical component of the goal configuration where C needs to be on D and D on E. With block D occupied by block B, and block E clear on the table, repositioning block C directly onto block D isn’t immediately possible without further rearrangements.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, block C should eventually be stacked on block D. However, block D is not yet ready to receive C since block B is on top of it. Placing block C directly on D is not currently possible. The most strategic move would be to set block C on block E first, as this aligns it closer to the final desired position. Once block C is on E, further actions can be taken to move block D onto E and then re-stack C appropriately.

Action: stack(c:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, we have five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their status:

1. Block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
2. Block b is on top of block d and block b itself is clear.
3. Block c is on top of block e and it is also clear.
4. Both blocks d and e are on the table.
5. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.

This setup provides a clear overview of the location and status of each block, which is crucial for planning any movement or reconfiguration of the blocks using the available actions (pick-up, put-down, stack, and unstack).
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand empty and the blocks arranged with C on E and B on D, there is a need to rearrange to meet the goal where C is on D and D on E. The current configuration has block C placed on E, which is part of the path towards the goal but not yet correct.

Think: To align with the goal, block D needs to be placed on E first, and then block C should be stacked on D. Currently, block C is already on E, which is a step in the right direction. The next step should involve preparing D to be stacked on E. To achieve this, block B must be removed from D. The valid action to unstack B from D is available and aligns with this plan, freeing up D to be subsequently moved to its correct position atop E.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Blocks a, e, and d are placed directly on the table.
- Block c is stacked on top of block e.
- The robot hand is holding block b.
- Blocks a, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing placed on top of them. 

This setup forms the basis for the robot to make decisions on moving blocks to achieve a desired goal configuration using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand is holding block B, and block C is already stacked on block E, which is only partially aligned with the goal. The goal requires block D to be directly on block E, and then block C on top of block D. Block D is clear and on the table, making it accessible for the necessary stacking action.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, block D needs to be stacked on block E first. However, holding block B, the robot is positioned to perform an immediate action with B. Since stacking B on D or C does not contribute directly to the goal state and could potentially complicate the configuration, the optimal move would be to put down block B on the table. This keeps the environment simpler and the robot hand free to manipulate the crucial blocks D and E in subsequent moves.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Four of these blocks (A, B, D, E) are placed directly on the table. Block C is positioned on top of block E. Regarding the status of the blocks, A, B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations such as picking up or manipulating the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, which allows flexibility to manipulate blocks as needed. Block C is currently on E but needs to be on D, with D on E to meet the goal state. The configuration needs to be adjusted by moving blocks D and E into the correct positions before placing C on top.

Think: Given the goal and current state, the first logical step is to prepare block D to be placed on E. Since block D is clear and on the table, it can be picked up and eventually stacked on E. Picking up block D will allow for this maneuver in subsequent actions. The available action to unstack C from E also aligns with this strategy, as it clears block E for the stacking of D which is a key requirement for achieving the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(c:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the summary of their arrangement and status:

1. Blocks A, B, D, and E are all placed on the table.
2. Block C is being held by the robot hand.
3. Blocks A, B, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This setup implies that all blocks on the table are freely accessible for the robot to perform actions such as stacking or picking up, except for Block C which is currently in the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block C, which is a key component of the goal state where C needs to be directly on top of D, and D directly on top of E. Currently, blocks D and E are clear and on the table, which provides an opportunity to align them according to the goal configuration.

Think: To progress towards the goal, the immediate step should involve placing block D on top of block E, as this sets the foundation for the final desired stack. Since block C is in the robot's hand and D and E are both clear, the most strategic move is to first place block C on block D. This action directly contributes to the goal by positioning C correctly, assuming that D will be subsequently stacked on E in following moves.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five objects identified as blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. All of these blocks are situated on a table, except for block c which is stacked on top of block d. Among these blocks, a, b, c, and e are clear, meaning no other block is placed on top of them, allowing for potential movement or stacking. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it's ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that block C is already on top of block D, which partially aligns with the goal state. However, block D is not yet on top of block E as required. The robot hand is empty, providing the opportunity to manipulate the blocks to achieve the final configuration.

Think: To move towards the goal, block D needs to be positioned on block E. However, block C is currently on top of D, preventing any immediate action on D. The best approach is to first remove block C from D to free up block D. This can then allow block D to be manipulated in future actions to be placed on block E. Utilizing the valid action to unstack block C from D aligns with this strategy.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the summary of their arrangement and status:

1. Blocks A, B, D, and E are all placed on the table.
2. Block C is being held by the robot hand.
3. Blocks A, B, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This setup implies that all blocks on the table are freely accessible for the robot to perform actions such as stacking or picking up, except for Block C which is currently in the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is currently holding block C, which is essential for achieving the goal state where C needs to be directly on top of D, and D directly on top of E. Blocks D and E are clear and placed on the table, providing a direct opportunity to align them as per the goal configuration.

Think: To move towards the goal, the immediate step should be to stack block D on top of block E, setting the foundation for the final desired stack. Since block C is already in the robot's hand and the next action involves manipulating D, the best strategy is to put block C temporarily on the table. This action will keep the environment simple and the robot hand free to manipulate block D in subsequent moves, such as picking it up and stacking it on E.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. These blocks and their relationships are described as follows:

1. All blocks A, B, C, D, and E are on the table.
2. Blocks A, B, C, D, and E are all clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
3. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.

This setup outlines a scenario where all blocks are independently placed on the table and are accessible for manipulation by the robot.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With all blocks clear and on the table, and the robot's hand empty, the environment is set for direct actions to achieve the goal state. The goal requires stacking block C on D and D on E, so the sequence of moves should strategically lead to this configuration.

Think: The first step towards achieving the goal is to establish the base of the desired stack, which involves block D on E. Since the robot's hand is empty, picking up block D to eventually stack it on E would be a logical initial action. This sets the foundation for then placing block C on top of D in subsequent actions.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within a Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The robot hand is currently holding block D. Blocks A, B, C, and E are placed on the table. Additionally, all the blocks on the table (A, B, C, and E) are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them, allowing for potential manipulation like stacking or picking up.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block D, and the goal is to stack block D on E, followed by stacking C on D. This sequence must be carefully planned to ensure that each block is in the correct position for the final configuration.

Think: Since block D needs to be directly on block E as part of the goal state, and block E is clear and available on the table, the most effective next step is to stack block D directly onto block E. This action aligns with the goal configuration and sets the stage for subsequently placing block C on top of block D.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the configuration:
- Blocks a, b, c, and e are placed directly on the table.
- Block d is stacked on top of block e.
- Blocks a, b, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of these blocks.
- The robot's hand is empty and ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and block D is already positioned on block E, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, block C is not yet on block D. The current setup allows for manipulation to achieve the goal configuration, specifically working towards placing block C on block D.

Think: Since block D is already on E but the goal requires block C to be on D, the immediate requirement is to make block C accessible for stacking. Given that block C is clear and on the table, the straightforward action is to pick up block C. Picking up block C will prepare it to be stacked on block D in subsequent moves, moving closer to achieving the goal state.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five blocks named A, B, C, D, and E, and a robot hand. Currently:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear.
- Block B is on the table and it is clear.
- Block C is being held by the robot hand.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block E and it is clear.
- Block E is on the table.

The robot hand's actions involve manipulating these blocks, such as stacking or unstacking them from each other, or moving them to and from the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is directly on top of block D, and block D is directly on top of block E. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.

Reflect: The robot currently holds block C, and the goal state involves stacking block C on block D, which is already correctly positioned on block E. This setup is close to the desired configuration, requiring only the correct placement of block C to achieve the goal.

Think: Since block D is already on E and the robot hand holds block C, the immediate and necessary action to achieve the goal state is to stack block C on block D. This action directly aligns with the goal configuration, making it the most efficient and straightforward choice.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
