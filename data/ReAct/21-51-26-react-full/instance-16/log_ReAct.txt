ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table. Currently, the robot's hand is empty. Block A is on the table and is clear on top, meaning nothing is stacked on it. Similarly, Block B is also on the table and clear. Block C is on the table, but Block D is stacked on top of it. Block D is clear.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is placed on top of block B, and block D is situated on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by using the robot hand to manipulate the blocks through picking up, stacking, unstacking, and putting down actions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In this scenario, the robot's hand is empty, and the goal is to rearrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The valid actions include picking up blocks that are clear and unstacking the one pair of blocks that are stacked.

Think: Since the robot's hand is empty, the first logical step is to make other blocks available for repositioning. Block D is currently on top of Block C, which prevents Block C from being moved directly onto Block B as required by the goal state. Therefore, unstacking Block D from Block C is the necessary first action. This will clear Block C for subsequent manipulation and will put Block D in the robot's hand, aligning with the goal state requirements.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block D. Blocks A, B, and C are placed on the table. Each of these blocks (A, B, and C) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is placed on top of block B, and block D is situated on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by using the robot hand to manipulate the blocks through picking up, stacking, unstacking, and putting down actions.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding Block D, and all other blocks (A, B, C) are clear on the table. The goal requires Block D to be placed on top of Block A. This aligns with one of the valid actions available, which is to stack Block D directly onto Block A.

Think: Since stacking Block D on Block A directly contributes to achieving the goal state and aligns with the valid actions provided, this action should be prioritized. After stacking D on A, the robot's hand will be free, and focus can then shift to manipulating Block C onto Block B as required by the goal state.

Action: stack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is either on the table or on top of another block. Specifically, blocks a, b, and c are placed on the table. Block d is stacked on top of block a. Blocks b, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is placed on top of block B, and block D is situated on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by using the robot hand to manipulate the blocks through picking up, stacking, unstacking, and putting down actions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is currently empty, and Block D is already stacked on Block A, which partly fulfills the goal state. The next important step is to manipulate Block C so that it can be placed on top of Block B as required.

Think: Since Block C needs to be stacked on Block B and the robot's hand is empty, the most straightforward action is to pick up Block C. Picking up Block C will enable the robot to subsequently stack it on Block B, which is clear and ready to receive another block on top.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within a Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Hereâ€™s a summary of their arrangement and status:

1. Block A is placed on the table.
2. Block B is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
3. Block D is positioned on top of Block A and is clear as well.
4. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.

This setup indicates that both Blocks B and D are accessible for movement by the robot, while Block C is ready to be placed down or stacked on another block. Block A supports Block D but is not directly accessible until D is moved.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is placed on top of block B, and block D is situated on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by using the robot hand to manipulate the blocks through picking up, stacking, unstacking, and putting down actions.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current scenario has the robot hand holding Block C, which is intended to be placed on top of Block B according to the goal state. This arrangement is feasible given the current state and the valid actions available. Block D is already correctly positioned on top of Block A, aligning with part of the goal state.

Think: The direct action to progress towards the goal state is to stack Block C on Block B. This action will not only free up the robot's hand but also achieve the required position of Block C as per the goal state. Since stacking C on B is a valid action and directly supports achieving the goal, it is the most logical next step.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)
