ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, block C is placed on top of block B. All blocks A, B, C, and D are on the table, specifically, blocks A, B, and D are directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty at the moment. Moreover, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them, allowing for direct interaction or movement by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'd' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty and can pick up or unstack clear blocks. The goal configuration requires stacking blocks in a specific order, which must be considered strategically to avoid unnecessary moves.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block A must be placed on top of block B, and block D on top of block A. Currently, block C is on top of B, which obstructs the stacking of A on B. The first step should involve removing block C from block B. Since block C is clear and on top of B, the valid move is to unstack C from B.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and D are placed on the table, and each of these blocks (A, B, and D) is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block C. This setup allows for various movements such as picking up or putting down blocks, and stacking or unstacking them to achieve different configurations.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'd' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Having successfully unstacked block C from block B, the robot's hand is now holding block C. The goal configuration requires block A to be stacked on B, and block D on A. Therefore, block C should not be stacked back on these blocks as it would interfere with achieving the goal configuration.

Think: The robot hand holding block C should place it in a position where it does not obstruct the necessary stacking of blocks A, B, and D. Since block C is not required in the goal configuration, the best move is to place it back on the table. This would free the robot hand for further actions and keep all blocks accessible for the required stacking.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is situated on the table. Additionally, the top surfaces of all blocks A, B, C, and D are clear, indicating that no other blocks are stacked on them. The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'd' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block C has been successfully put down on the table, leaving the robot's hand empty and ready for the next steps. The goal is to stack block A on B and then D on A. Since the robot hand is empty, it can now pick up any block.

Think: To proceed towards the goal state, block A must be stacked onto block B first. This requires picking up block A since it is directly on the table and clear. Once A is in the robot's hand, the next step will be to stack it on block B.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, blocks B, C, and D are on the table. Block A is being held by the robot hand. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'd' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block A is currently held by the robot's hand, which aligns well with the next step towards achieving the goal. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, allowing for versatile movement and stacking options.

Think: The goal requires block A to be on top of block B first. Given that block A is already in the robot’s hand and block B is clear and on the table, the straightforward action is to stack block A directly on block B. This action directly contributes to the goal state configuration.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks are arranged as follows: Block A is stacked on top of Block B, while Blocks B, C, and D are all placed directly on the table. The top surfaces of Blocks C, D, and A are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'd' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has successfully placed block A on top of block B, which is a significant step towards the goal state. The robot's hand is now empty, and block D needs to be stacked on A to achieve the final goal configuration.

Think: Since block D is clear and on the table, and the goal requires it to be placed on block A, the next logical step is to pick up block D. Once D is in the robot’s hand, it can be stacked on top of block A, completing the arrangement needed for the goal state.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
The current state in the environment includes four objects: three blocks labeled as a, b, and c, and one robot hand labeled as d. Here is the configuration and status of each:

1. Block a is on top of block b and block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block b is on the table.
3. Block c is also on the table and is clear.
4. The robot hand (d) is currently holding block d.

This setup describes a scenario in a blocks world where blocks can be stacked on each other or placed on the table, and the robot hand can hold a block.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'd' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, which is a crucial step toward achieving the goal. Block A is correctly placed on top of block B, aligning with part of the goal state, and block A is clear and ready to have another block stacked on it.

Think: The goal requires block D to be stacked on top of block A. Given that the robot hand is holding block D and block A is clear, the appropriate action is to stack block D on block A. This action will fulfill the goal state requirements.
