ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a scenario involving five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The robot's hand is currently empty. Here's the configuration of the blocks:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block A and is clear.
- Block C is on the table.
- Block D is on the table and is clear.
- Block E is on the table and is clear.

This setup indicates no blocks are on top of Blocks C, D, and E, allowing them to be manipulated. The robot can perform actions such as picking up a clear block or stacking one block on another clear block.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It is essential to understand the current state of the blocks and the robot's capabilities to handle them effectively. The robot can only pick up clear blocks or unstack blocks that are on top of others.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block C, which is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B, it is necessary to first clear block A by unstacking block B. Then, action can be taken to rearrange the other blocks accordingly.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The blocks a, c, d, and e are placed directly on the table. Blocks a, c, d, and e are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block b.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block B, which means the action choices involve placing block B either on the table or on top of another clear block. The goal setup requires block D to be on top of block B, so positioning block B appropriately is crucial.

Think: Since the goal state requires block D to be on top of block B, and block B is already held by the robot, it would be logical to place block B directly on the table. This allows block D, which is already clear and on the table, to be eventually stacked on block B without any constraints. This step is essential before arranging the other blocks as per the goal state.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, we are in an environment that involves five blocks named A, B, C, D, and E. All these blocks are placed directly on the table. Each block (A, B, C, D, and E) is clear, meaning no other block is stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating any of the blocks. This setup is critical for planning the next moves to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot's hand currently empty and all blocks clear and on the table, actions must be strategically chosen to build the stack formations required in the goal state. The robot needs to start assembling the stacks in a way that aligns with the final arrangement without needing to reposition blocks multiple times.

Think: The goal requires block C to be at the base of a stack with block A on top of C and C on top of E. To start building this stack, the first logical step is to pick up block E (since it needs to be at the bottom of one stack per the goal state) and prepare it for stacking.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the following conditions are observed:

1. Blocks a, b, c, and d are all placed on the table.
2. Blocks a, b, c, and d are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
3. The robot hand is currently holding block e.

The set of objects includes five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Each block is either positioned on the table or being manipulated by the robot.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)
- stack(e:default,b:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot is holding block E, which needs to be at the base of the stack involving blocks C and A for the goal configuration. Itâ€™s critical to place block E correctly as the foundation for subsequent actions.

Think: Considering the goal configuration, where block C must be placed on top of block E and then block A on top of block C, it is strategic to place E at the base. Since block C needs to be clear to have A stacked on it later, placing E on the table as a foundation for C is the appropriate action at this stage.

Action: put-down(e:default)

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand currently empty and all blocks clear and on the table, the task involves strategically picking up and stacking blocks to achieve the goal configuration. The necessary stacking sequence, based on the goal, should be carefully crafted starting from the base layers.

Think: According to the goal, block E needs to be at the bottom of one stack (with C and A on top), and block B at the bottom of another stack (with D on top). Starting with block E seems logical as it forms the base of the primary stack. By picking up block C next, it can then be stacked on E, followed by stacking A on C, thereby completing one major component of the goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The current configuration is as follows:
- Blocks A, B, D, and E are placed on the table.
- Blocks A, B, D, and E are also clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block C.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block C, which needs to be part of the stack with E at the base and A on top. The immediate goal is to place C correctly to align with the required configuration.

Think: Given the goal where block C must be on top of block E, and since block E is clear and on the table, the next logical step is to stack block C on top of E. This action aligns with the goal state's requirement and sets the stage for placing block A on top of C subsequently.

Action: stack(c:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. The table setup is as follows:

- Blocks a, b, d, and e are on the table.
- Block c is on top of block e.
- Blocks a, b, d, and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on these blocks.
- The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and block C (which is already on top of block E) is clear. The current configuration is partially aligned with the goal state, with block C correctly placed on E. The next step involves correctly positioning block A and block D as per the goal.

Think: Since the goal requires block A to be on top of block C, and block C is already positioned on E, the immediate action should be picking up block A to prepare for stacking it on top of block C. This action will progress the configuration towards the goal state.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block C is clear and is stacked on top of Block E.
- Blocks B, D, and E are clear and are placed directly on the table.
- Block A is being held by the robot hand.

This setup allows for further actions such as moving Block A or manipulating other clear blocks for stacking or repositioning.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block A, which according to the goal state, should be stacked on top of block C. Block C is already correctly placed on block E, aligning well with part of the goal state configuration.

Think: To progress towards the goal, the next step should involve stacking block A on top of block C. This will complete a significant portion of the goal state, where block A is on top of block C, which is on top of block E. After this, the remaining task will be to address the placement of block D on block B.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the current state involves five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The robot's hand is currently empty. Here's a breakdown of the location and status of each block:

- Block E is on the table.
- Block B is on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block D is on the table and is clear.
- Block C is on the table with Block A on top of it.
- Block A is clear and stacked on top of Block C.

This setup suggests that Blocks A, B, and D are available for the robot to interact with directly, either to move or to have another block stacked on top of them.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has block A already stacked on block C, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, block C needs to be on top of block E, not on the table. Additionally, block D needs to be placed on block B to meet the goal requirements.

Think: To proceed towards the goal configuration, it's necessary to rearrange block C on top of block E. However, block A must first be removed from block C. Then block C can be picked up and stacked onto block E in subsequent steps. The immediate action now should be to unstack block A from block C, considering that the robot's hand is empty and ready for this action.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block C is clear and is stacked on top of Block E.
- Blocks B, D, and E are clear and are placed directly on the table.
- Block A is being held by the robot hand.

This setup allows for further actions such as moving Block A or manipulating other clear blocks for stacking or repositioning.

Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block A, and the configuration is almost aligned with the goal state. Block C is already correctly placed on top of block E. The task now involves correctly positioning block A to complete this part of the goal configuration.

Think: Since block C is already on block E, the next logical step is to stack block A on top of block C, which directly aligns with the goal state requirements. This action completes the stack of A, C, and E as required. The remaining task will be to address the placement of block D on block B, which can be approached subsequently.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the current state involves five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The robot's hand is currently empty. Here's a breakdown of the location and status of each block:

- Block E is on the table.
- Block B is on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block D is on the table and is clear.
- Block C is on the table with Block A on top of it.
- Block A is clear and stacked on top of Block C.

This setup suggests that Blocks A, B, and D are available for the robot to interact with directly, either to move or to have another block stacked on top of them.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the configuration of block A on top of block C aligns with the goal state, but block C needs to be on top of block E, not on the table. Additionally, block D needs to be positioned on top of block B. Since the robot's hand is empty, the next actions should strategically move towards placing these blocks as required in the goal.

Think: Since block C needs to be on top of block E to meet the goal state and block A needs to remain on top of block C, it is not efficient to unstack A from C at this point. Instead, focusing on the other part of the goal where block D must be placed on top of block B is more efficient. Picking up block D to prepare for stacking it on block B would be the next logical step.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a robot hand. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block D is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks E and B are on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block C, and Block C is on top of Block E.
- Blocks A and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

This setup involves a stack where Block A is directly above Block C, which in turn is directly above Block E. Block B is positioned independently on the table. The robot hand is occupied with holding Block D.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand and multiple blocks that can be moved around. The robot can either hold one block at a time or have its hand empty. Blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration is very close to the goal state. Block A is correctly placed on top of Block C, and Block C is on top of Block E, matching part of the goal state. The robot hand is currently holding Block D, which needs to be placed on top of Block B as per the goal state requirements.

Think: Since the robot is holding Block D and the goal state requires Block D to be on top of Block B, and considering that Block B is clear and available on the table, the most straightforward and correct action is to stack Block D on Block B. This action will complete the goal state configuration.
