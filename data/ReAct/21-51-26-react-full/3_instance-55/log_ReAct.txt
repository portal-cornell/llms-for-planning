ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. The current state of the environment includes the following configurations and conditions:

1. The robot's hand is empty.
2. Block B is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
3. Block A is positioned on top of Block C.
4. Block C is also on the table but is not clear since Block A is on it.
5. Block A is clear as there is no other block on top of it.

This setup is part of a scenario where the goal might be to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration using the robot's actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld scenario described, the environment consists of several blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is resting on it. The robot hand is capable of holding a single block or remaining empty.

The ultimate objective in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block C is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot's hand is empty, and only blocks B and A are clear. The actions available are to pick up block B or unstack block A from C.

Think: To achieve the goal of having block C directly on top of block B, block A must first be moved from its current position on top of C. The valid action available for this is to unstack block A from C. This action will make block C clear, allowing subsequent moves to achieve the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are three blocks named A, B, and C. Block C is clear and is on the table. Block B is also clear and on the table. The robot hand is currently holding Block A. This setup forms the initial state of the environment where the blocks are positioned on the table or being held, and some blocks are clear, indicating they have nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld scenario described, the environment consists of several blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is resting on it. The robot hand is capable of holding a single block or remaining empty.

The ultimate objective in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block C is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Now that Block A is in the robot's hand, the available actions include putting it down or stacking it on Blocks B or C. Since the goal is to have Block C on top of Block B, Block A needs to be placed such that it does not interfere with this configuration.

Think: Since the goal is to have Block C on top of Block B, it's important to keep Block B clear for now. Therefore, the best action would be to put Block A down on the table, keeping Block B clear for the subsequent placement of Block C.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are three blocks labeled a, b, and c. All of these blocks are currently placed on a table. Each block, a, b, and c, is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty and available to perform actions such as picking up any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld scenario described, the environment consists of several blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is resting on it. The robot hand is capable of holding a single block or remaining empty.

The ultimate objective in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block C is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, all blocks are on the table and clear, with the robot's hand empty. The goal is to stack Block C on top of Block B.

Think: To achieve the goal, the first step is to pick up Block C, as it needs to be placed on top of Block B. Since the robot's hand is empty, we can directly use the action to pick up Block C.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block A and Block B are both placed on the table, and they are not stacked on top of each other or any other blocks, making both of them clear. The robot hand is currently holding Block C. This setup allows for potential actions like placing Block C on the table or stacking it on either Block A or Block B, given that both are clear.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld scenario described, the environment consists of several blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of each other or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is resting on it. The robot hand is capable of holding a single block or remaining empty.

The ultimate objective in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block C is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With Block C in the robot's hand and both Blocks A and B clear on the table, we are in a position to directly achieve the goal.

Think: Since the goal is to have Block C directly on top of Block B, and this action is directly available, the next step is straightforward. We should use the stack action to place Block C on Block B.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)
