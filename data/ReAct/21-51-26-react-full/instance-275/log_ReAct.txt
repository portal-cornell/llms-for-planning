ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, which involves a robot hand and blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D positioned on a table, the state can be described as follows:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
3. Block B is stacked on top of block D.
4. The top surfaces of blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of them. 

This setup forms the basis from which the robot can begin to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in the given environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup should create a single, vertical stack of blocks in the order A, B, C, D from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to create a vertical stack of blocks in the order A, B, C, D. The robot hand is empty, and block B is the only block not directly on the table but stacked on block D. The valid actions available involve picking up blocks A or C, or unstacking B from D.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, the robot should work on clearing block D so that C can be placed on top of it. Since the robot hand is empty and block B is on top of D, the first logical step is to unstack B from D. This will make block D clear and ready to have block C stacked upon it later.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table. Blocks A and D are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. Block C is also on the table and clear. The robot hand is currently holding block B.
Goal State:
The goal in the given environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup should create a single, vertical stack of blocks in the order A, B, C, D from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block B, and the goal is to have a vertical stack with block A on top of B, B on top of C, and C on top of D. Blocks A, C, and D are clear and on the table. 

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, block B needs to be stacked on block C first. Since block C is clear and on the table, and the robot hand is holding block B, the immediate and strategic action is to stack block B onto block C. This will align with the ultimate goal of having B on C, then C on D, and finally A on B.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and their status:

1. Block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block b is on top of block c and it is clear.
3. Block c is on the table.
4. Block d is on the table and it is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup forms the basis for any actions that might be taken to rearrange the blocks according to a specified goal, using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the given environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup should create a single, vertical stack of blocks in the order A, B, C, D from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal state requires block A to be on top of B, B on top of C, and C on top of D. Currently, block B is on top of C, which aligns with part of the goal, but it will need to be adjusted to eventually stack C on D. The robot hand is empty, which allows for picking up blocks or unstacking.

Think: The first step towards reorganizing the blocks to match the goal configuration is to make block D clear to act as the base of the stack. Since block B is currently on block C and the goal requires B to eventually be on top of C again, unstacking B from C allows us to prepare C to be stacked onto D later. This action also keeps the robot hand occupied with block B, which is a necessary step towards rearranging the blocks in the goal order.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B. The goal requires stacking B on C, then C on D, and finally A on B. Blocks A, C, and D are all clear and on the table. 

Think: Since block B needs to be on C to meet the goal configuration, and considering the robot is currently holding B while block C is clear and available on the table, the most direct action to progress toward the goal is to stack B on C. This aligns with the goal stateâ€™s requirement and efficiently uses the robot's current status (holding B) to make progress.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and their status:

1. Block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block b is on top of block c and it is clear.
3. Block c is on the table.
4. Block d is on the table and it is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup forms the basis for any actions that might be taken to rearrange the blocks according to a specified goal, using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the given environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup should create a single, vertical stack of blocks in the order A, B, C, D from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has B on top of C, which is part of the desired final configuration where A is on top of B, B on top of C, and C on top of D. However, to align with the goal, C needs to be on top of D. The robot's hand is empty, making it possible to manipulate the blocks as needed.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, it's necessary to clear the way to place C on D. Since B is on top of C, the first logical move is to unstack B from C. This will make block C free to be stacked on D later, aligning with the goal's requirements, and will also occupy the robot's hand with block B, which can afterwards be strategically placed as required.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and the goal is to stack B on C, then C on D, and finally A on B. Blocks A, C, and D are clear and on the table.

Think: The next logical step towards achieving the goal configuration is to stack block B on C since C is clear and on the table, and this action directly aligns with the goal of having B on top of C. This action is necessary before stacking C on D, and ultimately stacking A on B.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has block B on top of C, which fits part of the goal configuration except that block C needs to be on top of D. The robot's hand is empty, allowing for actions that involve picking up or unstacking.

Think: To move towards the final goal configuration, C needs to be on top of D. Currently, B is on top of C, preventing any direct action on C. The first logical step is to unstack B from C, which will free up C to be later stacked on D. This action will also occupy the robot's hand with block B, which can then be strategically placed later.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal is to stack B on C, then C on D, followed by A on B. Blocks A, C, and D are all clear and available on the table.

Think: The immediate action towards the goal is to stack B on C, as C is clear and this action directly aligns with the goal configuration. This will set the foundation for subsequently stacking C on D and A on B.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has B on top of C, which partially aligns with the goal configuration, but C needs to be on top of D. The robot's hand is empty, which is suitable for picking up or unstacking blocks as necessary.

Think: To progress toward the goal configuration, C needs to be available to stack on D. Since B is currently on top of C, the first logical action is to unstack B from C. This will make C available to be later stacked on D, aligning with the goal setup. This action also strategically uses the robot's empty hand to hold block B, which can then be placed according to the goal requirements.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

The goal in the given environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup should create a single, vertical stack of blocks in the order A, B, C, D from top to bottom.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal is to stack B on C, then C on D, and finally A on B. Blocks A, C, and D are clear and on the table.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, the first step is to stack block B on C since C is clear and on the table. This action directly aligns with the goal of having B on top of C, setting the foundation for subsequently stacking C on D and A on B.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
