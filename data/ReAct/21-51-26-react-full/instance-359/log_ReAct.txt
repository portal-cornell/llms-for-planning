ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D along with a table. Here’s the current configuration of these blocks:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A is directly on the table.
- Block D is also directly on the table.

Furthermore, Block A and Block C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to perform actions like picking up clear blocks or stacking blocks that are clear, utilizing the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since there is no error feedback, the previous actions (if any) were valid. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to have A on C and C on D, with block A currently clear and pickable, and block C clear but stacked on B.

Think: Block C needs to be on D, but it is currently on B. The first step should be to free block C from B without disrupting the rest of the structure unnecessarily. Since block C is clear and on top of block B, the most direct action is to unstack C from B. This will make block B clear and block C will be in the robot’s hand, ready to be placed on D subsequently.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Here's the status of each:

1. Block A is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is stacked on top of Block D and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of B.
3. Block C is currently being held by the robot hand.
4. Block D is on the table with Block B on top of it.

The environment consists of these blocks interacting on a table with the robot hand managing their placement.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action to unstack C from B was successful, and now block C is in the robot's hand. The goal is to arrange block C directly on top of block D, and then stack block A on top of block C.

Think: Block D is currently on the table with block B on top of it, which means block D is not clear and therefore cannot directly receive block C. To progress towards the goal configuration, the next step should be to stack block C directly on block D. However, as block B is on top of D, we must first put down block C on the table to clear the hand and then rearrange block B.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, as well as a robot hand. Currently, block A is clear and located on the table. Block B is clear and placed on top of block D, which is also on the table. Block C is clear and on the table as well. The robot hand is empty at the moment. This setup forms the initial state of the environment where some blocks are stacked while others are directly on the table, and the robot hand is not holding any blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action to put down block C was successful, and block C is now clear on the table. The robot's hand is empty, and block D, the desired base for block C, still has block B on top of it.

Think: To align with the goal of placing block C on block D, block B must be removed from block D. The only action available to move towards this configuration, given the current state, is to unstack block B from block D. This will clear block D, making it ready to receive block C.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D along with a table and a robot hand. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Blocks A, C, and D are on the table.
- Block B is being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions such as moving blocks by picking up or stacking them depending on the goal configuration to be achieved.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Successful unstacking of block B from D has been achieved, and block B is now in the robot's hand. Blocks A, C, and D are clear on the table. The goal is to stack C on D and then A on C.

Think: To progress towards the goal configuration, block C needs to be stacked on block D next. However, block B is currently in the robot's hand and needs to be placed down to free the hand. The best action now is to put down block B so the hand can be free to manipulate block C.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is placed directly on the table, and none of them has another block stacked on top. This means that all blocks A, B, C, and D are clear. Additionally, the robot hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action to put down block B was successful, and now all blocks A, B, C, and D are clear and on the table. The robot hand is empty, allowing for new actions to manipulate the blocks toward the goal configuration.

Think: The next step towards the goal is to stack block C on block D. Since block C is clear and on the table, the robot hand should first pick up block C to prepare for stacking it on block D.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current state of the blocks and the robot hand:

- Blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table.
- Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block C. 

This setup indicates that all blocks except for block C are on the table without any blocks stacked on them, and block C is being held by the robot, ready to be placed or stacked as needed.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block C is now in the robot's hand, and the blocks A, B, and D are clear on the table. The goal requires stacking block C on block D to eventually place block A on top of block C.

Think: To align with the goal, the immediate action necessary is to stack block C on block D. This is the next step in achieving the desired configuration of having block C on block D, followed by placing block A on top of C.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, blocks A, B, and D are directly on the table. Block C is placed on top of block D. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not holding any blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block C has been successfully stacked on block D, aligning with part of the goal configuration. The robot hand is empty, and block A remains clear and on the table.

Think: The final step to achieve the goal is to stack block A on top of block C. Since block A is clear and the robot hand is empty, the next logical action is to pick up block A in preparation for stacking it on block C.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block C is clear with no other blocks on top of it, and it is placed on top of block D. Block B is also clear and is positioned on the table. Block A is currently being held by the robot hand. Lastly, block D is on the table. This setup outlines the initial state of the environment and the positions and conditions of each block.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup requires careful manipulation using the available actions to achieve the desired configuration of blocks A, C, and D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block A has been successfully picked up by the robot hand and is ready to be placed according to the goal configuration. Blocks C and D are already correctly arranged with C on top of D.

Think: To complete the goal configuration, block A needs to be stacked on top of block C. Given that block A is in the robot’s hand and block C is clear and properly positioned on block D, the next action should be to stack block A directly on block C.
