ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, the robot hand is empty. Block A is placed on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear. Block B is stacked on top of Block C, and Block B is also clear. Block C is directly on the table. This setup of blocks and the status of the robot hand summarizes the current state of the environment.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is directly on top of block A, and block C is directly on top of block B. This setup involves a vertical stack with block A at the base, followed by block B, and then block C on top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It is crucial to carefully analyze the current state and compare it to the goal state to understand which actions will effectively transform the current configuration into the desired one. 

Think: To achieve the goal state of B on A and C on B, starting with B on C, the first logical step is to free B from C so it can later be placed on A. The robot hand is empty, allowing for the unstacking or picking up of blocks. Given that Block B is clear and on top of Block C, and considering the valid actions provided, the appropriate action is to unstack B from C.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block A is on the table and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block C is also on the table and is clear. Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is directly on top of block A, and block C is directly on top of block B. This setup involves a vertical stack with block A at the base, followed by block B, and then block C on top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Having the block B in hand provides the opportunity to directly stack it as needed to progress toward the goal state. It's essential to follow the goal configuration accurately to avoid unnecessary moves.

Think: The goal is to have B on A and then C on B. Currently, B is in the robot hand and both A and C are on the table and clear. The priority is to place B on A first, as this directly corresponds with the next step in achieving the goal configuration. The valid action "stack(b:default,a:default)" directly aligns with this need.

Action: stack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current state of these objects:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on top of block a.
- Block c is also on the table.
- Both block b and block c are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is directly on top of block A, and block C is directly on top of block B. This setup involves a vertical stack with block A at the base, followed by block B, and then block C on top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: By successfully stacking block B on block A, the next task is to stack block C on top of block B to achieve the goal state. It's important to proceed with actions that efficiently lead towards this end configuration.

Think: The robot hand is currently empty, and block C is clear and on the table. The goal state requires C to be stacked on B. To facilitate this, the first step is to pick up block C since this action is available and aligns with the goal of stacking it next.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot hand is currently holding block C. Block A is positioned on the table, and block B is stacked on top of block A. Additionally, block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is directly on top of block A, and block C is directly on top of block B. This setup involves a vertical stack with block A at the base, followed by block B, and then block C on top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With block C in the robot hand and block B already stacked on A, the next logical move is to stack C on B to match the goal configuration.

Think: The goal is for block C to be on top of block B. Since block B is clear and block C is held by the robot hand, the action to stack C on B is available and directly contributes to achieving the goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)
