ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block D is on the table, and the robot hand is empty. Block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is stacked on top of block A. Block B is positioned on top of block C and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block B. This setup forms a tower of blocks with the sequence D at the bottom, followed by A, then C, and B at the top.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given that the robot hand is currently empty, and the only valid action right now is to unstack one block from another, I must choose an appropriate block to unstack that does not violate the rules and moves us towards achieving the goal state.

Think: The goal state requires Block A to be positioned on top of Block B, and Block C on top of Block D. To achieve this, I need to dismantle the current tower without breaking the possibility of forming the goal configuration. The top block, B, is clear and can be unstacked from Block C. This action will allow further manipulations of the blocks underneath.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

1. Block a has block c placed on top of it.
2. Block d is positioned on the table.
3. Block a is also directly on top of block d.
4. Block b is currently being held by the robot's hand.
5. Block c is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.

This setup forms part of a blocks world scenario where the robot can interact with these blocks by stacking, unstacking, picking up, and putting them down to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block B, and the goal configuration requires Block A on top of Block B, and Block C on top of Block D. To align with the goal, placing Block B directly now might not be strategically advantageous since it needs to be under Block A.

Think: Since Block C is clear and Block B is in the robot's hand, stacking Block B on top of Block C is a valid move and aligns with the eventual goal of having Block A on top of Block B, and Block C on top of Block D. This action will make Block B clear, setting the stage for further necessary configurations.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block D is on the table, and the robot hand is empty. Block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is stacked on top of block A. Block B is positioned on top of block C and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block B. This setup forms a tower of blocks with the sequence D at the bottom, followed by A, then C, and B at the top.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state remains unchanged from the initial state described previously, where Block B is clear and on top of Block C. The robot hand is empty, and the only valid action available is to unstack blocks. To progress towards the goal state, adjustments in the configuration of the blocks need to be made according to their required positions in the goal state.

Think: The goal configuration requires Block A to be on top of Block B and Block C on top of Block D, with Block D on top of Block A. To start rearranging towards this goal, I need to dismantle the current tower. Since the robot hand is empty and Block B is clear, unstacking Block B from Block C is a logical step. This will free up Block B to be potentially placed under Block A later, as required by the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

1. Block a has block c placed on top of it.
2. Block d is positioned on the table.
3. Block a is also directly on top of block d.
4. Block b is currently being held by the robot's hand.
5. Block c is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.

This setup forms part of a blocks world scenario where the robot can interact with these blocks by stacking, unstacking, picking up, and putting them down to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Previously, the robot was holding Block B, and the valid actions were to either put it down or stack it. The goal state requires a complex rearrangement, notably needing Block A on top of Block B, and Block C on top of Block D, with an additional twist of Block D being on top of Block A.

Think: Since Block B is in the robot's hand and Block C is clear (and on top of Block A), stacking Block B onto Block C aligns with the part of the goal where Block A needs to be below Block B. This action would make Block B the new top of the tower, potentially allowing future actions to rearrange Blocks A and D as needed.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block D is on the table, and the robot hand is empty. Block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is stacked on top of block A. Block B is positioned on top of block C and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block B. This setup forms a tower of blocks with the sequence D at the bottom, followed by A, then C, and B at the top.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty again, and Block B remains clear on top of Block C in the current configuration. Consistently, the only valid action available is to unstack blocks. The goal state requires a specific arrangement where some blocks need to be swapped to achieve the desired configuration. Unstacking blocks strategically will be essential to rearrange them accordingly.

Think: Considering the goal state, Block B eventually needs to be under Block A, but for now, it's at the top of the tower. To begin restructuring, I should continue to dismantle the current tower while considering future moves. Unstacking Block B from Block C will enable the robot hand to potentially use Block B in a new position as required in the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

1. Block a has block c placed on top of it.
2. Block d is positioned on the table.
3. Block a is also directly on top of block d.
4. Block b is currently being held by the robot's hand.
5. Block c is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.

This setup forms part of a blocks world scenario where the robot can interact with these blocks by stacking, unstacking, picking up, and putting them down to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot is holding Block B, indicating that a decision involving this block needs to be made. The goal state involves a complex stacking order where Block B is beneath Block A, which is currently not feasible as Block A is below Block C and Block D.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, it may be strategic to continue rearranging the blocks to open up more possibilities. Given the valid actions, placing Block B on the table by using the put-down action might be a good move to make the hand free for future operations. This will allow flexibility in picking up and rearranging other blocks like A, C, or D to better approach the goal setup.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is positioned on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. Blocks B and D are placed directly on the table. Blocks B and C are clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has changed, with Block B placed directly on the table and the robot's hand now empty. Block C is clear and on top of Block A, and Block A is on top of Block D. To move towards the goal configuration, which requires a specific placement of blocks on one another, strategic picking up and unstacking are necessary.

Think: Given the goal state requirements, Block A needs to be placed on Block B, and Block C needs to be on top of Block D. To facilitate this configuration, unstacking Block C from Block A is a crucial first step. This will free Block A and allow for potential repositioning to achieve the goal state. Since Block C will be in the robot's hand, subsequent actions can be planned to position it correctly.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Block A is positioned on top of Block D. Both Blocks B and D are directly on the table. The robot is currently holding Block C. Blocks A and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block C, and both Blocks A and B are clear. With the goal in mind, Block C needs to be positioned on top of Block D, while Block D should ultimately be on top of Block A. At this stage, placing Block C correctly is crucial for achieving the goal configuration.

Think: Since the goal requires Block C on top of Block D and Block D is currently on the table, the best action to align with this goal is to put down Block C directly onto Block D. This places Block C in its correct position according to the goal state, and also frees up the robot's hand for further moves, such as rearranging Block A and Block B as needed.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(c:default,d:default)' is not valid. Please provide a valid action.
Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Block A is positioned on top of Block D. Both Blocks B and D are directly on the table. The robot is currently holding Block C. Blocks A and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The proposed action to stack Block C on Block D was invalid as it was not listed among the valid actions. This reminds me to strictly adhere to the actions provided in the valid actions list for each step.

Think: Given the valid actions and the goal state requirements, the best course of action is to put Block C down directly on the table. This move aligns with the goal of needing Block C on top of Block D, and putting Block C down will allow for future actions that could involve picking up and stacking Block D or other necessary rearrangements.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, block A is placed on top of block D and both are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block B and block C are directly on the table and they are also clear. The robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setup allows the robot to potentially pick up any of the clear blocks (A, B, or C) or to manipulate them according to the goal of the task.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and there are several clear blocks available for interaction. The goal requires a complex stacking order, and the immediate available actions are picking up Block B, picking up Block C, or unstacking Block A from Block D. 

Think: To move towards the goal state configuration, it's necessary to realign Block D to be under Block A, as specified in the goal. The first feasible step towards this rearrangement is unstacking Block A from Block D. This action will make both Block A and Block D available for future stacking actions that align closer with the goal state requirements.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as a, b, c, and d, which are all blocks. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block a is being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks b, c, and d are each on the table.
- Blocks b, c, and d are all clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged in a way that allows easy manipulation, such as stacking or moving, as the robot hand is already holding one block (a), and the others are accessible and not obstructed.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block A, and all other blocks (B, C, D) are clear on the table. The goal configuration requires a specific stacking order where Block A eventually needs to be on top of Block B, and Block D needs to be under Block A. However, Block C also needs to be on top of Block D, suggesting a careful sequence of actions.

Think: Given the goal state, the immediate beneficial action would be to place Block A on top of Block D since the final configuration requires Block D to be under Block A. This step is strategic as it aligns two critical blocks in their near-final positions, especially since Block D will eventually need to support Block A.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, block A is placed on top of block D and both are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block B and block C are directly on the table and they are also clear. The robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setup allows the robot to potentially pick up any of the clear blocks (A, B, or C) or to manipulate them according to the goal of the task.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and Block A is currently stacked on top of Block D, which aligns with a part of the goal state where Block D needs to eventually be beneath Block A. However, the goal also requires Block A on top of Block B and Block C on top of Block D. Strategic manipulation of the blocks is required to reach the goal configuration.

Think: Considering the current state and the goal, the next logical step is to facilitate the placement of Block C on top of Block D, as this aligns with the final goal structure. Picking up Block C will allow subsequent actions to stack it on Block D. This action also preserves the current beneficial position of Block A on Block D, which is a part of the final goal.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Block A is positioned on top of Block D. Both Blocks B and D are directly on the table. The robot is currently holding Block C. Blocks A and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block C, and the goal configuration requires Block C to be stacked on top of Block D. The immediate task is to place Block C in a position that aligns with the final configuration requirements.

Think: Among the valid actions, stacking Block C on Block D directly aligns with the goal state, where Block C needs to be on top of Block D. Since Block D is currently under Block A and not directly accessible for stacking, the feasible action to progress towards the goal is to put Block C down. This will make Block C available on the table, potentially allowing future actions to rearrange Block D as needed.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, block A is placed on top of block D and both are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block B and block C are directly on the table and they are also clear. The robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setup allows the robot to potentially pick up any of the clear blocks (A, B, or C) or to manipulate them according to the goal of the task.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot's hand empty and several blocks accessible, the current situation allows for strategic manipulation to work towards the goal state. Notably, Block A is currently on Block D, which is a part of the final goal configuration where Block D needs to be beneath Block A. However, the full goal configuration also requires rearranging other blocks.

Think: To progress towards the goal state configuration, it's key to start aligning other blocks while maintaining the beneficial placement of Block A on Block D. Picking up Block B is a strategic move since the goal requires Block A to be on top of Block B. By having Block B in the robot's hand, it prepares for a potential subsequent action to stack Block A on Block B after adjusting the position of Block D if necessary.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here is the configuration and status of each:

1. Block d is on the table.
2. Block c is also on the table and has no other blocks on top, making it clear.
3. Block a is placed on top of block d and has no other blocks on top, making it clear.
4. The robot's hand is currently holding block b.

This setup outlines the initial state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block B, and the arrangement of other blocks is such that Block A is on Block D, and Block C is clear on the table. The goal state requires some specific stacking orders, including Block A on top of Block B and Block C on top of Block D, with Block D also needing to be on top of Block A, which is a complex configuration.

Think: Given the goal and the current state, a strategic move towards achieving the goal state would be to stack Block B under Block A. This action aligns with the requirement of the goal state where Block A should be positioned on top of Block B. Since Block A is clear and on top of Block D, stacking Block B under it directly supports part of the goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

- Block A has Block B placed on top of it.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block C is also positioned on the table.
- Block D supports Block A.
- Blocks B and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup describes the initial states of the blocks relative to each other and their status concerning the robot's hand and the table.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state almost meets parts of the goal state with Block A on top of Block B. However, the complete goal configuration requires Block C on top of Block D, and Block D should be on top of Block A, which is a challenging order. The robot’s hand is empty, and the actions available are either to pick up Block C or to unstack Block B from Block A.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, we need to rearrange Block D and Block C appropriately. Since Block C is clear and on the table, picking it up will prepare for the subsequent action of stacking it on Block D, which aligns with the goal state of having Block C on top of Block D.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
The current environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Here's the configuration and status of each:

1. Block A has Block B on top of it, making Block A not clear.
2. Block B is clear, indicating nothing is on top of it.
3. Block D is on the table, which makes it accessible but not clear since Block A is on top of it.
4. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.

This setup involves Blocks B and D being clear, Block C being held by the robot, and a stacking order where Block B is on Block A, which in turn is on Block D.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block C, and the goal configuration requires Block C to be on top of Block D. The current stacking of A, B, and D does not directly interfere with placing Block C, but it requires careful maneuvering to meet all elements of the goal state.

Think: Since Block D is on the table with Block A on top of it, the action to stack Block C on Block D directly aligns with the goal state requirement of having Block C on top of Block D. However, the only valid actions available are to put down Block C or to stack it on Block B. Given these constraints and the ultimate need to rearrange the blocks correctly, the best move now is to put Block C down on the table, maintaining flexibility for future rearrangements, especially considering that stacking C on B does not progress towards the goal state.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

- Block A has Block B placed on top of it.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block C is also positioned on the table.
- Block D supports Block A.
- Blocks B and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup describes the initial states of the blocks relative to each other and their status concerning the robot's hand and the table.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has Block A with Block B on top, and both Block C and Block D are clear on the table. The robot’s hand is empty, which provides flexibility for the next move. The goal requires a unique stacking sequence, which includes Block C on top of Block D, and Block D on top of Block A.

Think: To achieve the goal state, Block C needs to be stacked on Block D. Since the robot's hand is empty, the first step toward this part of the goal is to pick up Block C. This action will enable the subsequent possibility of stacking it on Block D, aligning with the goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
The current environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Here's the configuration and status of each:

1. Block A has Block B on top of it, making Block A not clear.
2. Block B is clear, indicating nothing is on top of it.
3. Block D is on the table, which makes it accessible but not clear since Block A is on top of it.
4. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.

This setup involves Blocks B and D being clear, Block C being held by the robot, and a stacking order where Block B is on Block A, which in turn is on Block D.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding Block C, and there are specific positions required in the goal state: Block C on top of Block D. Currently, Block D is under Block A, making it not directly accessible for stacking Block C on it. The valid actions are to either put down Block C or stack it on Block B.

Think: Considering the goal and the current state, putting Block C directly on Block B does not align with the final required configuration. To maintain flexibility and keep options open for future moves that will allow repositioning of Block D or A, it is prudent to put down Block C. This action keeps the robot's hand free for possible reconfiguration in subsequent moves.

Action: put-down(c:default)

- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, which allows flexibility in choosing actions to progress towards the goal. The current configuration has Block A on top of Block D, with Block B on top of Block A, and Block C clear on the table. The goal requires a complex stacking order, including reversing the positions of Blocks A and B and placing Block C on top of Block D.

Think: To work towards the goal state, it's necessary to reposition Block B under Block A. Since the robot's hand is empty and Block B is clear on top of Block A, unstacking Block B from Block A would allow subsequent actions to rearrange them correctly (placing Block A on Block B, as required). This action is a strategic move to disassemble the existing stack, making it possible to build the desired configuration.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here is the configuration and status of each:

1. Block d is on the table.
2. Block c is also on the table and has no other blocks on top, making it clear.
3. Block a is placed on top of block d and has no other blocks on top, making it clear.
4. The robot's hand is currently holding block b.

This setup outlines the initial state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks: Block A should be positioned on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and importantly, Block D should be on top of Block A, creating a specific stacking order among these blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block B, and the blocks are in various positions that are partially conducive to the goal state. Specifically, Block A is on Block D, which is an element of the final desired configuration, though Block D ultimately needs to be on Block A, requiring careful reordering.

Think: The goal state requires Block A to be on top of Block B and Block C on top of Block D. With Block B in the robot's hand, the immediate strategic action that aligns with the goal is to stack Block B underneath Block A. This move progresses towards the goal by positioning Block A on top of Block B, setting up a part of the desired final configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,a:default)
