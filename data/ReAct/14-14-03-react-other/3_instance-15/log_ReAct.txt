ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The current state of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block 'a' is positioned on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block 'b' is also on the table.
- Block 'c' is stacked on top of block 'b', and since nothing is on top of 'c', it is clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms the initial configuration for the Blocksworld scenario, where the goal typically involves rearranging these blocks into a new configuration using the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, there are blocks labeled as "a" and "b" and a table. The goal is to arrange block "a" on top of block "b". The robot hand in this scenario can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, stacking them, or placing them on the table. The robot can only hold one block at a time, and it must ensure that any block it wants to pick up or stack is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it. The ultimate objective is to configure the blocks such that block "a" is directly on block "b".
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot hand is empty and there are two valid actions available, focusing on these actions to progress towards the goal is crucial. The goal is to stack block 'a' on block 'b', which requires block 'b' to be clear.

Think: Currently, block 'c' is on top of block 'b', which makes 'b' not clear. Therefore, the first logical action is to make block 'b' clear by removing block 'c' from on top of it. The valid action to accomplish this is 'unstack(c:default,b:default)', which fits the requirement as it directly addresses the obstruction by block 'c'.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as "a", "b", and "c". Currently, blocks "a" and "b" are both on the table and they are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block "c". This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as putting down block "c" or stacking it on either block "a" or block "b", given that they are clear.
Goal State:
In this environment, there are blocks labeled as "a" and "b" and a table. The goal is to arrange block "a" on top of block "b". The robot hand in this scenario can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, stacking them, or placing them on the table. The robot can only hold one block at a time, and it must ensure that any block it wants to pick up or stack is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it. The ultimate objective is to configure the blocks such that block "a" is directly on block "b".
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With block 'c' in the robot's hand, the immediate concern is utilizing it in a way that aligns with reaching the goal of stacking block 'a' on block 'b'. Since stacking 'c' on either block does not directly contribute to the goal configuration, it's prudent to consider other placements for 'c'.

Think: To achieve the goal, block 'b' must be clear to allow block 'a' to be stacked upon it. Since block 'b' is already clear and the robot hand is occupied with block 'c', the best course of action is to put down block 'c' on the table. This action keeps block 'b' clear and frees up the robot hand, potentially allowing subsequent actions to focus directly on manipulating block 'a'.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Each of these blocks is currently positioned on the table. Blocks 'a', 'b', and 'c' are all clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
In this environment, there are blocks labeled as "a" and "b" and a table. The goal is to arrange block "a" on top of block "b". The robot hand in this scenario can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, stacking them, or placing them on the table. The robot can only hold one block at a time, and it must ensure that any block it wants to pick up or stack is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it. The ultimate objective is to configure the blocks such that block "a" is directly on block "b".
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given that all blocks are clear and the robot hand is empty, selecting the appropriate block to pick up becomes crucial to efficiently achieving the goal configuration. The goal is to place block 'a' on top of block 'b'.

Think: To align with the goal of stacking 'a' on 'b', the best initial action is to pick up block 'a' since it needs to be moved above block 'b'. Picking up block 'a' will prepare for a subsequent action to stack it on block 'b', directly contributing to the goal.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block B and Block C are both positioned on the table. Additionally, both Block B and Block C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding Block A.
Goal State:
In this environment, there are blocks labeled as "a" and "b" and a table. The goal is to arrange block "a" on top of block "b". The robot hand in this scenario can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, stacking them, or placing them on the table. The robot can only hold one block at a time, and it must ensure that any block it wants to pick up or stack is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it. The ultimate objective is to configure the blocks such that block "a" is directly on block "b".
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block 'a', which is essential in achieving the goal state where block 'a' needs to be placed on top of block 'b'. Both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear and on the table, which offers a straightforward opportunity to proceed towards the goal.

Think: Considering the goal is to stack block 'a' on block 'b', and block 'b' is clear and ready to receive block 'a', the most direct action aligning with the goal is to use the 'stack(a:default,b:default)' action. This action will place block 'a' directly onto block 'b', which is the intended final configuration of the blocks as specified by the goal state.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)
