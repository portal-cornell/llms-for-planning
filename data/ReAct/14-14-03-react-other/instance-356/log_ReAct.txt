ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the arrangement and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block b is on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
2. Block d is placed on top of block a. Block d is also clear.
3. Block a is on top of block c, which is located on the table.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves blocks being stacked on each other and some resting on the table, with the robot hand ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking the blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block B. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific stacking order as described.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves a stacking arrangement where block d is on top of block a, and block a is on top of block c. The goal state requires rearranging these blocks so that block a is on top of block d and block c is on top of block b. The robot hand is empty, which means we can either pick up a clear block or unstack a block that is on top of another.

Think: To progress towards the goal, the first logical step is to free up block a since it needs to be placed on block d eventually. To do this, block d must be moved away from block a. The robot hand is empty, and the valid action available to achieve this is to unstack block d from block a.

Action: unstack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

1. Block B is placed on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block C is also on the table and similarly clear.
3. Block A is positioned on top of Block C, which means Block A is not clear as it might have other blocks or the robot hand interacting with it.
4. The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

The environment involves these blocks and their configurations where the goal would typically be to rearrange them according to a specified state using a series of actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block B. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific stacking order as described.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, which is a critical block in achieving the goal state where block A needs to be on top of block D. The current valid actions allow for either putting down block D or stacking it on top of block A or block B.

Think: To align with the goal state, block D needs to be directly under block A. However, block A is currently on top of block C. The ideal next step involves positioning block D in such a way that it can later receive block A. Since block A is not clear and currently not accessible for stacking, the best action now is to place block D on the table to free up the robot hand, enabling future moves like unstacking block A from block C.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's a summary of the current state:
- Blocks B, C, and D are on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block C.
- Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is empty.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block B. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific stacking order as described.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently empty, and the immediate requirement is to rearrange the blocks to match the goal state. Block A needs to be on top of block D, and block C needs to be on top of block B. Block A is currently on top of block C, which needs to be moved to achieve the desired stacking.

Think: To move towards the goal state, it's necessary to free block C so it can be placed on block B later. The first step should be to make block C available for future actions by removing block A from on top of it. The current valid action that allows this is unstacking block A from block C.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The blocks B, C, and D are all situated on the table and each of these blocks is clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of them. Block A is currently being held by the robot hand. This scenario outlines the initial state of the blocks relative to each other and the robot's interaction with them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block B. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific stacking order as described.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block A, which is crucial for achieving the goal state where block A must be on top of block D. The valid actions include different stacking possibilities for block A or putting it down on the table.

Think: The goal state requires block A to be directly on top of block D. Since block D is clear and on the table, the straightforward action to progress towards the goal is to stack block A on top of block D. This aligns perfectly with the goal state requirement.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- Block A is on top of Block D.
- Blocks B, C, and D are each on the table.
- Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block B. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific stacking order as described.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and part of the goal state has already been achieved with block A on top of block D. The remaining requirement is to stack block C on top of block B. Currently, both blocks B and C are clear and on the table.

Think: To make progress towards the goal state, the next step should be to pick up block C so it can be stacked on block B. Since block C is clear and the action to pick it up is valid, this move aligns well with the goal state needs.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration of these items:

1. Block B is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block D is also on the table and clear.
3. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.
4. Block A is positioned on top of Block D and is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block A.

This setup indicates the starting positions and states of each block, crucial for planning the robot's actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D and block C positioned on top of block B. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific stacking order as described.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block C, and part of the goal state is already achieved with block A positioned on top of block D. The other part of the goal is to have block C positioned on top of block B.

Think: Given that block B is clear and on the table, and the goal requires block C to be on top of block B, the appropriate action is to stack block C on block B. This action directly moves towards completing the goal state configuration.
