ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robotic hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. There are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block D is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block A.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block C, and it is clear, meaning nothing is on top of Block B.

This setup of blocks and the state of the robotic hand provide a clear snapshot of the current environment in the scenario.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block B. This setup involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up, stack, and unstack blocks, as well as put them down, to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot hand is empty, and there are specific constraints on which blocks can be interacted with based on their current positions and clear status.

Think: To achieve the goal state where B is on D and C is on B, the first step is to clear the way by moving Block B. Since Block B is clear and on top of C, the valid action to take is unstacking B from C. This will make Block C clear and allow further manipulation towards the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described blocks world environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block d is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block a is also on the table and is clear.
- Block c is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is currently being held by the robot hand. 

This setup indicates that the robot can perform various actions such as putting down block b, or possibly stacking it on block c or a, given that both are clear.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block B. This setup involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up, stack, and unstack blocks, as well as put them down, to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding Block B, and in the previous action, Block B was successfully unstacked from Block C. The goal is to arrange Block B on Block D and then place Block C on top of Block B. 

Think: The appropriate next step towards achieving the goal state is to stack Block B on Block D since Block D is clear and on the table. This aligns with the goal to have B directly on D, preparing for the subsequent placement of C on B.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the current configuration of blocks and the robot hand's state are as follows:

- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'c' is clear and is placed on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'b' is clear and is placed on top of block 'd'.
- Block 'd' is on the table.

The blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are the objects involved in this scenario.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block B. This setup involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up, stack, and unstack blocks, as well as put them down, to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is now empty, and the previous action successfully placed Block B on Block D. The current state is almost aligned with the goal state, with Block B already on top of Block D. However, Block C needs to be moved from its current position on Block A to on top of Block B.

Think: The first step to rearrange Block C is to unstack it from Block A, where it is currently placed. This will make Block C available to be moved on top of Block B, aligning perfectly with the goal state.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks: A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:
- Block A is clear and is directly on the table.
- Block B is clear and is placed on top of Block D.
- Block C is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block D is directly on the table but has Block B on top of it. 

The robot hand's ability to move these blocks around is crucial for reconfiguring them as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block B. This setup involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up, stack, and unstack blocks, as well as put them down, to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block C has been successfully unstacked from Block A and is now held by the robot hand. The configuration is almost aligned with the goal, as Block B is already on top of Block D. The only remaining task is to place Block C on top of Block B.

Think: To complete the alignment with the goal state, the next step is to stack Block C on Block B. This action is valid and directly leads to achieving the goal configuration.
