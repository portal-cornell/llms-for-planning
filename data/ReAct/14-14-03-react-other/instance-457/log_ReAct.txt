ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of five blocks, labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, and a table. Currently, blocks A, B, and C are located directly on the table and each of these blocks is clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of them. Block D is placed on top of block E, and block E is also directly on the table. The robot hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot hand is empty and the goal is to rearrange the blocks with B on top of E, and D on top of B, the actions available are aligned with picking up blocks or unstacking the ones that are already stacked.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the first step should involve freeing up block D from block E, as it will need to be repositioned later. Since D is currently on E and part of the goal is to have B on E, it's logical to unstack D from E first. This will make E available for further actions and move D into the robot's hand.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario of the Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The setup is as follows:

- Blocks A, B, C, and E are on the table.
- Blocks A, B, C, and E are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is holding block D.

This state allows for various actions such as the robot placing down block D or stacking it on any of the clear blocks A, B, C, or E.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand currently holds block D, which ultimately needs to be stacked on block B according to the goal state. However, B itself needs to be on E before D can be correctly placed on top of B to reach the goal configuration.

Think: Given that the robot hand is holding D, and B needs to be placed on E before D can be placed on B, the logical step is to free up the robot hand by placing D temporarily on another clear block that doesn't interfere with achieving the goal. Block C is a suitable temporary spot for D because it is clear and its position doesn't affect the immediate steps needed to arrange B on E.

Action: stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Blocks a, b, c, and e are placed directly on the table. Block d is on top of block c. Each of the blocks a, b, e, and d are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty again, providing an opportunity to progress towards the goal state by manipulating the blocks as needed. Block D must eventually be placed on block B, and block B needs to be on block E.

Think: To proceed efficiently towards the goal, block D should be removed from block C, making D available to be eventually placed on top of B. Since the robot hand is empty, the immediate action should be to unstack D from C. This will put D in the robot hand and make C clear, which does not directly affect the goal but is necessary for repositioning D.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario of the Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The setup is as follows:

- Blocks A, B, C, and E are on the table.
- Blocks A, B, C, and E are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is holding block D.

This state allows for various actions such as the robot placing down block D or stacking it on any of the clear blocks A, B, C, or E.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, following the previous actions that facilitated removing D from C. The goal is to stack B on E and then D on B. Therefore, it is necessary to first position B correctly to subsequently stack D on it.

Think: Since block B needs to be on E to proceed towards the final goal configuration, and the robot hand is holding D, the next logical step is to temporarily place D somewhere it does not interfere with stacking B on E. Placing D on the table would be the simplest action that keeps other blocks clear and available for further manipulation.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, the environment consists of five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Each of these blocks is placed on the table, and there is nothing stacked on top of any of them, indicating that blocks A, B, C, D, and E are all clear. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment. This setup forms the basis for any manipulations or actions that might be planned to rearrange the blocks as required.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand now empty and all blocks clear on the table, the setup is ideal for beginning to structure the blocks to reach the goal state. The goal is to have block B on top of E, and then D on top of B.

Think: The first step towards achieving the goal is to place block B on top of block E. To do this, the robot should first pick up block B since it is clear and available.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a robot hand. Here's the summary of the situation:

- Blocks A, C, D, and E are on the table.
- Blocks A, C, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block B.

This setup indicates that all blocks except for Block B are directly on the table and free to be manipulated since there are no other blocks stacked on them. The robot hand is occupied with Block B, which is not on the table or under any other block.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, which is a crucial step towards achieving the goal. The goal state requires block B to be directly on top of block E, followed by block D on top of block B.

Think: Since the robot hand is holding B, and the next step in the goal is to have B on top of E, the immediate and necessary action is to stack B on E. This will set the foundation for the final arrangement where D will be placed on top of B.

Action: stack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, C, D, and E are all on the table.
- Blocks A, C, D, and E are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- Block B is on top of Block E.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.
  
This setup forms a scenario where most blocks are directly on the table and only one block (B) is stacked on another block (E). The robot hand being empty implies it is ready to perform an action like picking up or stacking a block.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration is now very close to the goal state, with block B already correctly placed on top of block E. The next and final step according to the goal is to place block D on top of block B.

Think: Since block D needs to be stacked on B and the robot hand is empty, the immediate action required is to pick up block D from the table, where it is clear and ready to be moved.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current configuration of blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

- Blocks 'c' and 'a' are on the table and both are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
- Block 'b' is stacked on block 'e', which is on the table. Block 'b' is clear.
- The robot hand is holding block 'd'.
- Block 'e' is also on the table but not clear since block 'b' is on top of it. 

This summary includes all the objects: blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e', and accurately describes their positions and statuses.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires precise manipulation by the robot hand using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve the desired setup.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the next step to achieve the goal state is to place D on top of B, which is already correctly positioned on E.

Think: With D in hand and B being clear and on top of E, the direct and necessary action to proceed towards the goal state is to stack D on B. This will complete the configuration required by the goal.
