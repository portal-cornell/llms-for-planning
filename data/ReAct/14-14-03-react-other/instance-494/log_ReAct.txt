ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Blocks a, b, d, and e are all on the table.
- Block c is on top of block b.
- Blocks a, c, d, and e are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks and the status of the robot hand in terms of placement and availability for manipulation.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is placed on top of block C, and block E is placed on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by strategically moving the blocks using the robot hand, which can either hold a block or be empty. The actions available to achieve this are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial setup has blocks a, b, d, and e on the table with block c on top of b. The goal requires block d on c and block e on a. My actions must consider the current clear blocks and the robot's empty hand.

Think: To achieve the goal, I need to rearrange blocks to match the desired configuration. Since the robot hand is empty, my first action should involve either picking up a block that is clear or unstacking block c from b. Picking up block d seems like a strategic move as it will later need to be stacked on block c, but first, c needs to be clear. Therefore, unstacking c from b is a logical first step, making both blocks c and b clear, and allowing further manipulation.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Blocks A, B, D, and E are placed on the table. The robot hand is holding block C. Blocks A, B, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This setup allows for various actions such as picking up a clear block, stacking one block on another, or the robot placing its held block down on the table.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is placed on top of block C, and block E is placed on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by strategically moving the blocks using the robot hand, which can either hold a block or be empty. The actions available to achieve this are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Following the previous action, the robot hand is now holding block C, and all other blocks are clear on the table. The goal state requires block D to be on top of block C, which means I need to prepare block C for stacking with D.

Think: Since block C needs to be placed on the table before it can be stacked with D (as per the goal where D is on C), the current optimal move is to put down block C back onto the table. This will allow the next steps to involve moving block D in preparation for the final configuration. Placing C on the table keeps the options open for subsequent stacking actions while aligning with the requirement that D be on top of C.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block (A, B, C, D, E) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as picking up any of the blocks since they are all accessible and the hand is ready to operate.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is placed on top of block C, and block E is placed on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by strategically moving the blocks using the robot hand, which can either hold a block or be empty. The actions available to achieve this are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: All blocks are now clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty, providing a fresh and flexible state for moving towards the goal configuration. The goal is to stack D on C and E on A.

Think: To progress towards the goal, stacking block D on C is a priority. To do this, I need first to pick up block D since it is clear and the hand is empty. After picking up D, I can then position it to be stacked on block C in a subsequent move.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The blocks A, B, C, and E are all placed on the table. Blocks A, B, C, and E are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block D. This setup of blocks and the robot's status allows for various movements like placing down the held block D, or picking up any of the clear blocks A, B, C, or E.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is placed on top of block C, and block E is placed on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by strategically moving the blocks using the robot hand, which can either hold a block or be empty. The actions available to achieve this are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and all other blocks A, B, C, and E are clear on the table. Our immediate goal is to have D on top of C, which aligns perfectly with the robot's current ability to stack D onto any of the clear blocks.

Think: Given that the goal is to place D on top of C, and C is clear on the table, this step is straightforward. I will choose to stack D directly onto C as it directly progresses towards achieving the part of the goal state where D must be on C.

Action: stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E are present. Blocks A, B, C, and E are on the table. Block D is stacked on top of Block C. All the blocks A, B, E, and D are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them. The robot hand is empty and ready to perform operations such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is placed on top of block C, and block E is placed on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by strategically moving the blocks using the robot hand, which can either hold a block or be empty. The actions available to achieve this are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state now matches part of the goal state, with block D successfully stacked on block C. The robot hand is empty, and the next task is to stack block E on block A to complete the goal configuration.

Think: With the robot hand empty and block E clear, the next logical step is to pick up block E. This will prepare it for the subsequent action of stacking it on block A, moving closer to achieving the full goal state configuration.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are five objects: blocks labeled as "a", "b", "c", "d", and "e". The setup of these blocks is as follows:

- Blocks "a", "b", and "c" are placed on the table.
- Block "d" is on top of block "c".
- Blocks "a", "b", and "d" are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block "e".

This configuration sets the stage for possible actions such as moving block "e" to a clear spot, or stacking and unstacking other blocks as needed.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is placed on top of block C, and block E is placed on top of block A. This configuration must be achieved by strategically moving the blocks using the robot hand, which can either hold a block or be empty. The actions available to achieve this are picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)
- stack(e:default,b:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block E, and the blocks are positioned such that block D is already on C, aligning with part of the goal state. The remaining task is to place E on A, which directly corresponds to the goal state.

Think: Since block A is clear and the robot hand currently holds block E, the direct action to progress towards the complete goal state is to stack E on A. This action will achieve the final configuration required by the goal.

Action: stack(e:default,a:default)
