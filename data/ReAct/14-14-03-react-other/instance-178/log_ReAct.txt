ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The robot hand is currently empty. The block arrangement is as follows:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is stacked on it.
- Block D is clear as well, but no specific location is mentioned for it in the predicates, suggesting it might be held by the robot earlier but now the hand is empty.
This configuration indicates that the blocks are partially stacked and there are clear blocks that the robot can interact with for potential reconfiguration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state and valid actions indicate that the robot hand is empty and the only actions possible are to pick up block C or unstack block D from B. However, in the current description, block D is mentioned to be clear, with no block on top or specified beneath it, implying it's not stacked under block B. This seems to be a discrepancy in the description of block D's location.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration, we need block D to be clear to stack block B on it, as per the goal. Since block D is already clear, picking up block C would not directly contribute to achieving the final configuration at this moment. The best approach would be to clarify the current position of block D and ensure it is freed up for subsequent actions, even though it's mentioned as clear. To resolve the discrepancy and proceed, I will choose to pick up block C, which is a valid and clear action, and this will also confirm the robot's ability to interact with other blocks.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, here is the current state:

- The robot is holding block C.
- Block D is on top of block B and block D is also clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block D.
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of block A.

This setup involves four blocks (A, B, C, D) interacting in a stack-and-table configuration, with block manipulation facilitated by a robot.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error in the previous state description about the position of block D was clarified. It is now confirmed that block D is on top of block B, and the robot is currently holding block C. The goal involves achieving a specific configuration which involves stacking blocks in a circular manner as well as independently.

Think: Given the goal configuration and the current state of blocks, the immediate action should focus on placing block C in a position that aligns with the final goal. The goal requires block A to be on top of block C. Since block C is currently held by the robot and block A is clear on the table, placing block C onto block D does not align directly with the final goal configuration but might be a step towards rearranging other blocks. However, putting down block C and later repositioning block A on top of it seems to be a more straightforward approach towards the goal. Therefore, putting down block C on the table (or in a clear space) would be a strategic move to facilitate future stacking actions aligned with the goal.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The robot hand is currently empty. The block arrangement is as follows:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is stacked on it.
- Block D is clear as well, but no specific location is mentioned for it in the predicates, suggesting it might be held by the robot earlier but now the hand is empty.
This configuration indicates that the blocks are partially stacked and there are clear blocks that the robot can interact with for potential reconfiguration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has been revisited, and it appears there was a reset to an earlier configuration, where the robot hand is empty, and blocks A, B, C, and D are arranged with potential for reconfiguration. Notably, Block D's position remains ambiguous as it is described as clear, but without a specific location mentioned, suggesting prior interactions might have altered its state.

Think: To align with the goal configuration, where block D needs to be placed on top of block A, it is crucial to first clarify and free block D if necessary. Since block D is clear and block B is on top of block A, picking up block C does not immediately contribute to achieving the goal configuration. To proceed effectively, understanding the true state of block D is crucial. However, the valid actions suggest focusing on blocks C and D. Picking up block C would allow for subsequent repositioning, possibly making room for rearranging other blocks like D in future steps.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, here is the current state:

- The robot is holding block C.
- Block D is on top of block B and block D is also clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block D.
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of block A.

This setup involves four blocks (A, B, C, D) interacting in a stack-and-table configuration, with block manipulation facilitated by a robot.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block C, and the goal requires block A to be on top of block C. Since block C is in the robot's hand, it can be directly manipulated to set the stage for the desired configuration. Block D is on top of block B, which means actions involving block D will need to consider block B's position.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, block C needs to be placed in a position that allows block A to be stacked onto it later. The action to stack block C onto block D aligns with the eventual goal structure, where block B needs to be on top of block D. By stacking block C onto block D now, block D will be in the correct position to support block B later. This action sets up a part of the final configuration directly and helps in progressing towards the overall goal.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment:

- The robot's hand is currently empty.
- Block 'd' is placed on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is placed on top of block 'd' and nothing is placed on top of block 'c', making it clear.
- Block 'a' is directly on the table.
- Block 'b' is stacked on top of block 'a'.

The objects involved are four blocks: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty again, and the blocks have been rearranged closer to the target configuration. Block C is now on top of Block D, which is a step towards the goal configuration, but there are still adjustments needed to align with the exact goal state.

Think: The goal requires block A to be on top of block C. Currently, block C is on top of block D, which is not directly useful for placing block A on top of block C. In order to align block C for placement under block A, it would be beneficial to make block C available by removing it from the top of block D. This action, while seemingly a step back, will provide the flexibility needed to rearrange block A as required in subsequent steps.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, here is the current state:

- The robot is holding block C.
- Block D is on top of block B and block D is also clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block D.
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of block A.

This setup involves four blocks (A, B, C, D) interacting in a stack-and-table configuration, with block manipulation facilitated by a robot.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block C again, similar to a previous state. Block D is clear and on top of block B, and block A is still on the table. The valid actions suggest that the robot can either put down block C or stack it on block D again. Given the goal configuration, the placement of blocks needs careful consideration to achieve the desired final arrangement.

Think: The goal requires block A to be stacked on top of block C. Since the robot is holding block C, and block A is on the table, it might be strategic to put block C down on the table, making it accessible for stacking block A on top of it in subsequent actions. Stacking block C on block D again would repeat a previous state which did not lead to progress towards the goal. Placing block C on the table prepares for rearranging block A on top of block C, aligning with the goal configuration.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The robot hand is currently empty. The block arrangement is as follows:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is stacked on it.
- Block D is clear as well, but no specific location is mentioned for it in the predicates, suggesting it might be held by the robot earlier but now the hand is empty.
This configuration indicates that the blocks are partially stacked and there are clear blocks that the robot can interact with for potential reconfiguration.
Goal State:

This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It appears the state has reset to an earlier configuration once again, where the robot hand is empty, and the blocks are arranged with C and D clear and on the table. This repetition suggests some cycling in actions without progressing towards the goal.

Think: Given that block C is clear and on the table, and the goal requires block A to be on top of block C, the first step should be to free block A. To do this, we need to unstack block B from block A, which will make block A available for subsequent actions. Currently, the valid actions allow for picking up block C or unstacking block D from block B. Since block D's position was previously ambiguous but now clarified as being on top of block B, unstacking block D from block B is the appropriate action to take. This will make block D available for further manipulation in alignment with the goal state.

Action: unstack(d:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration of these blocks and their respective states are as follows:

- Block b is placed on top of block a.
- Block c is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it, and it is also placed on the table.
- Block a is also on the table but has block b on top, so it is not clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.

This setup involves blocks being both on the table and stacked on each other, along with the interaction of the robot hand holding a block.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block D, which is a central piece in achieving the goal configuration. Block D needs to be stacked on block A as per the goal, but currently, block A is not clear, being underneath block B.

Think: To move towards the goal state, block D should ideally be stacked on block A. However, block A is not available for stacking due to block B being on top of it. Placing block D on block C does not directly align with the goal state requirements and would potentially complicate subsequent moves. Thus, the strategic action would be to put down block D in a clear space, freeing the robot's hand for the next move, which should ideally involve making block A accessible by unstacking block B from it.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block C is on the table and has nothing on top, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table and serves as the base for Block B, which is stacked on it. Block A itself is not clear because Block B is on top of it.
- Block B is clear as there is nothing on it.
- Block D is on the table and is clear, with nothing stacked on it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty and not holding any blocks. 

This setup involves the blocks being either directly on the table or stacked on one another, with the robot available to manipulate them as required.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and all blocks are either clear or can be made clear. The goal involves stacking blocks in a circular and specific configuration, which requires strategic manipulation of each block. 

Think: To achieve the goal configuration:
1. Block A needs to be on top of Block C.
2. Block B needs to be on top of Block D.
3. Block D needs to be on top of Block A.

Given that Block A is currently blocked by Block B, the immediate action should be to free Block A. This can be done by unstacking Block B from Block A. Once Block A is free, subsequent actions can focus on rearranging the blocks to achieve the circular configuration as per the goal. 

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are on the table and there is nothing on top of them, making them clear. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as putting down block B or manipulating the other blocks that are clear and on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A.

- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block B, and all other blocks (A, C, D) are clear and on the table. The strategic positioning of blocks to achieve the goal configuration requires careful consideration of where each block is placed.

Think: According to the goal:
1. Block A needs to be on top of Block C.
2. Block B needs to be on top of Block D.
3. Block D needs to be on top of Block A.

Currently, the robot is holding Block B, which is required to be stacked on Block D as per the goal. Placing Block B on Block D now would align with the goal configuration and make Block D less accessible for now, but it is a necessary step towards the goal. After placing Block B on D, the focus can shift to rearranging Blocks A and D appropriately.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, as well as a table and a robot hand. Here is the setup of the blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block C is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is also on the table and clear.
3. Block B is on top of Block D.
4. Block D is on the table.
5. Blocks B and D are clear.

The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that block B is correctly placed on top of block D, aligning with part of the goal state. However, block D needs to be on top of block A, which requires repositioning. Block A and block C are both clear and on the table, and block D is also clear but with block B on top.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration:
1. Block A needs to be on top of Block C.
2. Block B is already on top of Block D.
3. Block D needs to be on top of Block A.

The robot hand is empty, and a key move now would be to position block D on top of block A. However, block D is currently underneath block B. The first step should be to free block D by removing block B from on top of it. This will allow subsequent manipulation of block D, such as placing it on top of block A.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B.

Reflect: The robot is holding block B again, and all other blocks (A, C, D) are clear and on the table. From the goal state definition:
1. Block A needs to be on top of Block C.
2. Block B needs to be on top of Block D.
3. Block D needs to be on top of Block A.

Currently, the robot is holding Block B, which needs to be stacked on Block D according to the goal. This action directly aligns with the goal state requirements.

Think: Placing Block B on Block D is a key step towards achieving the goal state as it fulfills one of the required configurations (Block B on top of Block D). Once this is done, the focus can shift to arranging the other blocks to meet the remaining goal conditions.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and block B is already correctly placed on top of block D, which is part of the goal configuration. However, block A and block C are clear and on the table, and block D needs to be positioned on top of block A.

Think: The next steps should focus on achieving the circular configuration:
1. Block D needs to be on top of Block A.
2. Block A needs to be on top of Block C.

Since Block D is currently under Block B, moving Block B off Block D will allow for the manipulation of Block D. Picking up Block A is a good preparatory step, but it doesn't directly facilitate achieving the goal configuration unless Block A can be stacked somewhere beneficial. Unstacking Block B from Block D will free Block D, allowing the robot to subsequently stack Block D on Block A.

1. Block A on top of Block C.
2. Block B on top of Block D.
3. Block D on top of Block A.

Currently, the robot holding Block B aligns with part of the goal requirement, which is to have Block B on top of Block D.

Think: Given that Block B needs to be stacked on Block D per the goal configuration, and Block D is clear and available on the table, the most direct action to progress towards the goal is to stack Block B on Block D. This action fulfills one of the specific requirements of the goal configuration and sets up for the subsequent repositioning of the other blocks.

- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows Block B correctly placed on top of Block D, which aligns with part of the goal configuration. The other parts of the goal require placing Block D on top of Block A and Block A on top of Block C. The robot hand is currently empty, and the valid actions suggest the capability to either pick up Block A or Block C or to unstack Block B from Block D.

Think: To move towards achieving the goal configuration:
1. Block A needs to be placed on top of Block C.
2. Block D needs to be placed on top of Block A.

Considering that Block B is already correctly placed on Block D and needs no immediate repositioning, the focus should be on arranging Blocks A, C, and D. Picking up Block A would be a strategic step because it would allow for subsequent actions to stack it appropriately. However, since Block D eventually needs to be on top of Block A, picking up Block D (following its unstacking from Block B) and subsequently stacking it on Block A is essential.

The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows Block B correctly placed on top of Block D, which aligns with part of the goal configuration. The other parts of the goal require placing Block D on top of Block A and Block A on top of Block C. The robot hand is currently empty, and the valid actions suggest the capability to either pick up Block A or Block C or to unstack Block B from Block D.

Think: To move towards achieving the goal configuration:
1. Block A needs to be placed on top of Block C.
2. Block D needs to be placed on top of Block A.

Considering that Block B is already correctly placed on Block D and needs no immediate repositioning, the focus should be on arranging Blocks A, C, and D. Picking up Block A would be a strategic step because it would allow for subsequent actions to stack it appropriately. However, since Block D eventually needs to be on top of Block A, picking up Block D (following its unstacking from Block B) and subsequently stacking it on Block A is essential.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are on the table and there is nothing on top of them, making them clear. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as putting down block B or manipulating the other blocks that are clear and on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block B, which needs to be correctly positioned according to the goal state. The goal requires block B to be on top of block D, block A on top of block C, and block D on top of block A.

Think: Since the robot is holding block B, and one of the goal requirements is to have block B on top of block D, the most straightforward action to align with the goal is to stack block B on block D. This action directly contributes to achieving the goal configuration for block B and leaves block D in a position where subsequent actions can be planned to position it on top of block A.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, as well as a table and a robot hand. Here is the setup of the blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block C is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block A is also on the table and clear.
3. Block B is on top of Block D.
4. Block D is on the table.
5. Blocks B and D are clear.
6. The robot hand is currently empty.

This configuration of blocks and the status of the robot hand define the state of the environment in the Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:

- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows Block B correctly placed on top of Block D, which aligns with part of the goal configuration. The other parts of the goal require positioning Block D on top of Block A and Block A on top of Block C. The robot's hand is currently empty, and the valid actions include picking up Block A or Block C and unstacking Block B from Block D.

Think: To progress toward achieving the goal configuration:
1. Block A needs to be on top of Block C.
2. Block D needs to be on top of Block A.

Since Block B on Block D is already aligned with the goal, unstacking them would be counterproductive unless necessary for rearrangement of Block D. The immediate requirement is to position Block A on Block C, and since both are clear and on the table, picking up Block A to prepare for stacking it on Block C is a straightforward and effective action.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Block b is currently on top of block d. Both block c and block d are on the table. The robot hand is holding block a. Blocks b and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A should be on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This configuration suggests a circular stacking of blocks A, D, and C, with block B independently stacked on block D. The robot hand and actions available will be essential in achieving this arrangement from the current state of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block A, and the goal configuration involves placing block A on top of block C. The current state also shows Block B correctly placed on Block D, which aligns with the goal for Block B.

Think: To move towards the goal configuration:
1. Block A needs to be on top of Block C.
2. Block B is already on top of Block D, which is correct.
3. Block D needs to be placed on top of Block A eventually, but currently, Block A is in the robot's hand.

Since the goal includes stacking Block A on Block C and Block C is clear and available on the table, the direct action that aligns with achieving the goal is to stack Block A on Block C. This action will position Block A correctly according to the goal state and prepare for further maneuvering of Block D in future steps.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)
