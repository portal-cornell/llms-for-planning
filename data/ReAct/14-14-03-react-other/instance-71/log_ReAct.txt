ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The arrangement and status of these elements are as follows:

1. Block A is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is also on the table, but Block C is placed on top of it.
3. Block C, positioned on Block B, is clear, indicating there are no blocks on top of it.
4. Block D is on the table and is clear, with no other blocks on top.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the positions of all blocks and the status of the robot hand, ready for operations to rearrange the blocks as required.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the environment consists of several blocks and a table, manipulated by a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of each other or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is no other block on top of it, and the robot’s hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange block C on top of block B and block D on top of block A. This setup requires careful manipulation using actions like picking up and putting down blocks, or stacking one block on another.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot hand is empty, I can choose to pick up a block that is clear. Both blocks A and D are clear and available for pick-up. Block C is also clear but needs to be unstacked from B first to be used in any other operation.

Think: The goal is to have C on B and D on A. Since C is already on B, I need to focus on getting D onto A. Block D is clear and can be picked up directly, which is a valid action. Once D is in the robot's hand, I can then plan to stack it on A.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand’s status is as follows:

1. Block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
2. Block b is also on the table.
3. Block c is not on the table but instead, it is stacked on top of block b.
4. Block d is currently being held by the robot hand.

This setup indicates that blocks a and b are directly on the table, with block c placed on top of block b, and block a is free of any other blocks on it. The robot hand is occupied, holding block d.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the environment consists of several blocks and a table, manipulated by a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of each other or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is no other block on top of it, and the robot’s hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange block C on top of block B and block D on top of block A. This setup requires careful manipulation using actions like picking up and putting down blocks, or stacking one block on another.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, which aligns with the goal to place D on top of A. Since block A is clear, I can directly stack D onto A, which is one of the valid actions available.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, I need to place D on A. Since A is clear and on the table, and stacking D on A is a valid and direct action, this action will further progress towards the goal without needing to put down D first.

Action: stack(d:default,a:default)
