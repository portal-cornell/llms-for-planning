ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current state consists of the following configuration and conditions:

- The robot's hand is empty.
- There are four blocks, labeled as A, B, C, and D.
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is also on the table.
- Block D is clear, meaning it has no other blocks on top of it.
- Block C is also clear.

This setup describes a scenario in which the robot can manipulate these blocks (by picking, stacking, or moving) to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In the described environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block D is on top of block C. This configuration must be achieved using the actions available to the robot, which can pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks in order to meet this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Considering the current state and the goal, we must carefully select actions that move us towards arranging B on D and D on C. Since the robot's hand is empty, I should focus on the valid actions that involve picking up or unstacking blocks.

Think: The goal is to have B on D and D on C. Currently, D is clear and on the table, which is a favorable condition as it needs to be under B. However, B is currently on top of A, not D. Therefore, my first action should be to free B by unstacking it from A, making B ready to be moved later onto D. Since 'unstack(d:default,b:default)' is a valid action and directly addresses our need to free up B, this should be the initial action.

Action: unstack(d:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current state includes the following conditions:
- Block b is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block c is on the table.
- The robot hand is holding block d.
- Block a is also on the table.
- Block c is clear, indicating no other blocks are on top of it.
- Block b is positioned on top of block a.

This setup involves blocks placed directly on the table and some blocks stacked on top of others, with one block being manipulated by the robot.
Goal State:
In the described environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block D is on top of block C. This configuration must be achieved using the actions available to the robot, which can pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks in order to meet this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block D, which aligns well with our goal to place D either directly on top of block C or under block B. Given that our objective is for D to be on C, and then B on D, we need to focus on positioning D correctly first.

Think: Since block D needs to be on block C to eventually achieve the goal state, and since both 'stack(d:default,c:default)' and 'put-down(d:default)' are valid actions, the best immediate action is to stack D on C. This action directly contributes to our goal configuration by placing D in its correct position according to the goal state. Once D is on C, we can then focus on placing B on D.

Action: stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- Block B is positioned on top of Block A.
- Block D is placed on top of Block C.
- Both Blocks A and C are directly on the table.

Additionally, the top surfaces of Blocks B and D are clear, indicating that no other blocks are placed on top of them. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.
Goal State:
In the described environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block D is on top of block C. This configuration must be achieved using the actions available to the robot, which can pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks in order to meet this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal state requires B to be on top of D, and D to be on top of C. Currently, D is already on top of C, which is ideal. However, B is on top of A and needs to be moved to D. Since the robot's hand is empty, the focus should be on manipulating B to eventually place it on D.

Think: Since D is already correctly placed on C, and our next step is to position B on D, I need to free B from its current position on top of A. The valid action 'unstack(b:default,a:default)' directly allows us to pick up B from A, which is a necessary move to achieve our goal. This action will enable the robot to hold B, preparing it for future actions to stack it on D.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the following conditions are present:
- The robot hand is holding block b.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Blocks c and a are both on the table.
- Block d is placed on top of block c.
- Block a is also clear, indicating nothing is on top of it.

The objects involved in this scenario are blocks a, b, c, and d.
Goal State:
In the described environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block D is on top of block C. This configuration must be achieved using the actions available to the robot, which can pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks in order to meet this desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block B, and the goal is to stack B on D, with D already correctly placed on C. This is an advantageous situation as it aligns directly with our goal configuration.

Think: Given the robot is holding B and our target is to place B on D, the best and direct action to progress towards the goal is 'stack(b:default,d:default)'. This action will place B on top of D, which is exactly where it needs to be according to the goal state. Performing this action now leverages the current state efficiently and moves us closer to achieving the goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)
