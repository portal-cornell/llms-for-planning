ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld domain, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The robot hand is currently empty. Block B is on top of Block A, and Block A is on top of Block C. Blocks C and D are directly on the table. Both Block D and Block B are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is stacked on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently empty, and I need to rearrange the blocks to reach the goal state. I must ensure that each action aligns with the valid actions available in the current state.

Think: Since the goal is to have Block C on top of Block A, and Block A currently has Block B on top of it, I need to clear Block A first. The valid action available to start this process is unstacking Block B from Block A. This will make Block A clear, moving towards the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Block D and block C are both on the table. Block D is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block A is also clear and it is stacked on top of block C. The objects in this scenario are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is stacked on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Previously, I successfully unstacked Block B from Block A, and now the robot hand is holding Block B. The goal state requires Block C to be on top of Block A, and currently, Block A is clear and on top of Block C.

Think: To align with the goal, I need to ensure that Block A remains clear and accessible for Block C to be stacked on it later. For now, Block B, which is held by the robot hand, should be placed back on the table, keeping Block A clear. The action 'put-down(b:default)' is available and suits this purpose, as it doesn't interfere with the position of Block A or C.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Hereâ€™s a summary of the state of each block and the robot hand:

- Block A is on top of Block C.
- Block B is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block C is also on the table but has Block A on top of it.
- Block D is on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- The robot hand is empty, ready to pick up or manipulate blocks as necessary.

This setup forms the starting configuration for planning movements and achieving the desired block arrangement.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is stacked on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of blocks involves Block A being on top of Block C, which is not aligned with the goal state where Block C needs to be on top of Block A. The robot hand is empty, allowing for the manipulation of blocks.

Think: To reach the goal state, Block C must be placed on top of Block A. However, Block A is currently on top of Block C, so the first step is to free up Block C by removing Block A. The valid action 'unstack(a:default,c:default)' will allow me to pick up Block A from Block C, making Block C clear and ready to be manipulated in subsequent steps.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks B, C, and D are on the table and each block is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block A.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is stacked on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding Block A, and all the other blocks (B, C, D) are clear on the table. The goal is to have Block C on top of Block A, which requires positioning Block A on the table first and then placing Block C on top of it.

Think: Given that Block A is in the robot's hand and the goal is for Block C to be on top of Block A, the best move is to place Block A on the table. This action will prepare Block A to be the base for stacking Block C. The valid action 'put-down(a:default)' directly supports this by putting down Block A and making it available for the next stacking action needed to reach the goal state.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, all of which are placed on the table. Each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, prepared to perform operations such as picking up or stacking any of these blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is stacked on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and all blocks are on the table and clear. The goal is to stack Block C on top of Block A, requiring manipulation of these blocks to achieve the desired configuration.

Think: The sequence to achieve the goal involves picking up Block C and then stacking it on top of Block A. The first step is to pick up Block C, given that it needs to be moved on top of Block A. The valid action 'pick-up(c:default)' aligns perfectly with this plan as it will allow the robot hand to hold Block C, preparing for the subsequent stacking action.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. The blocks B, D, and A are placed on the table, and each is clear, indicating that nothing is stacked on them. The robot hand is currently holding block C.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is stacked on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding Block C, and the goal is to have Block C stacked on top of Block A, which is clear and on the table. This configuration is exactly what is needed to achieve the goal.

Think: With Block C in the robot hand and Block A clear on the table, the direct action to achieve the goal is to stack Block C on top of Block A. The valid action 'stack(c:default,a:default)' is available and perfectly suits the requirements to move directly towards the goal state without any unnecessary moves.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
