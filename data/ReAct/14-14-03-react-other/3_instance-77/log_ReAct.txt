ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Each of these blocks is currently placed on the table. Blocks 'a', 'b', and 'c' are all clear, which means there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to have block B placed on top of block C in a Blocks world environment where blocks can be rearranged using a robot hand that can pick up, put down, stack, and unstack blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since all blocks are on the table and clear with an empty robot hand, the actions available are only to pick up any block. There is no error feedback, so the previous step was successful or this is the initial move.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block B on block C, the first step should be to pick up block B. Once block B is in the robot's hand, future actions can be planned to stack it on block C.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block C is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
3. Block A is also on the table and is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

This setup indicates that the robot hand is occupied and two blocks are positioned separately on the table, each clear to be interacted with.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to have block B placed on top of block C in a Blocks world environment where blocks can be rearranged using a robot hand that can pick up, put down, stack, and unstack blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot successfully picked up block B as planned. Now, block B is in the robot's hand, and the available actions are to put it down or stack it on blocks A or C.

Think: The goal is to have block B on top of block C. Since block C is clear and on the table, the direct action available and aligned with achieving the goal is to stack block B on block C.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
