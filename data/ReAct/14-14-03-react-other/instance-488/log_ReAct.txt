ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and status of these elements:

- Block a is on the table and is clear.
- Block b is on the table.
- Block d is on top of block b.
- Block e is on top of block d.
- Block c is on top of block e, and it is clear.

The robot hand is currently empty. This setup involves stacked blocks with two clear blocks (a and c) that are accessible for the robot to interact with, using actions like picking up or stacking.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has a clear structure of blocks with b at the base of a stack, and a and c being clear. The goal structure requires a specific stack sequence from a to e. My actions need to carefully deconstruct and reconstruct the stack to match the goal.

Think: To achieve the goal state, I need to first clear the path to rearrange blocks accordingly. The first step should be to unstack block c from block e, making block e clear and allowing further manipulation of the blocks below it.

Action: unstack(c:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e, along with actions relating to moving these blocks. The current configuration and states of these blocks are as follows:

- Block a is on the table and is clear, which means nothing is on top of it.
- Block b is on the table.
- Block d is on top of block b.
- Block e is on top of block d and is clear.
- The robot is holding block c.

This setup involves blocks being stacked on top of each other, a single block being held by the robot, and certain blocks being clear indicating they can be interacted with or moved.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Previously, I successfully unstacked block c from e, which left block e clear and block c in the robot's hand. The goal configuration requires block c to be stacked on block a, followed by stacking d on c, and then e on d. 

Think: Since block a is already clear and on the table, it's an ideal step to stack block c directly on top of block a. This action aligns with our goal configuration and makes use of the current state where block c is already held by the robot.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block d is stacked on top of block b.
- Block e is stacked on top of block d.
- Block c is stacked on top of block a.
- Blocks a and b are placed directly on the table.
- The top surfaces of blocks c and e are clear, with nothing stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a part of the state that needs to be considered for planning actions such as stacking or unstacking blocks, or moving blocks from the hand to the table or vice versa.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the previous action, block c was successfully stacked on block a, aligning with the bottom part of the goal configuration. Now, block d and e need to be rearranged to complete the goal configuration by stacking d on c and then e on d.

Think: Since block e is clear and currently on top of block d, the next logical step is to unstack block e from block d. This will leave block d clear, allowing it to be manipulated in subsequent moves to stack it on block c, which is crucial for progressing toward the goal state.

Action: unstack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five objects identified as a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is also on the table.
- Block c is on top of block a and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
- Block d is on top of block b and is also clear.
- Block e is being held by the robot hand.

This setup involves blocks placed both on the table and stacked on top of each other, with the robot hand actively holding one block.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand currently holds block e, which is essential for reaching the goal state as it must be placed on top of block d after block d is stacked on block c. The configuration of blocks c and d being clear is advantageous as it allows for immediate stacking actions.

Think: According to the goal state, block e needs to be stacked on top of block d, which should eventually be stacked on block c. Given that the robot is currently holding block e and block d is clear, the next strategic move is to stack block e directly on block d, further progressing towards the goal configuration.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Blocks a and b are placed directly on the table.
- The top surfaces of blocks c and e are clear, with nothing stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a part of the state that needs to be considered for planning actions such as stacking or unstacking blocks, or moving blocks from the hand to the table or vice versa.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state reflects that block c is already correctly stacked on block a, which is part of the goal configuration. However, blocks d and e need to be rearranged such that d is on c and e on d to achieve the goal.

Think: Given that block e is currently stacked on d and the robot hand is empty, the immediate action that can help progress towards the goal state is to unstack block e from block d. This will make block d clear, preparing it for the next step of being stacked on block c.

Action: unstack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five objects identified as a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block d is on top of block b and is also clear.
- Block e is being held by the robot hand.

This setup involves blocks placed both on the table and stacked on top of each other, with the robot hand actively holding one block.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block e, and the goal is to stack it on block d, which in turn needs to be stacked on block c. Block c is already correctly placed on block a, aligning with the goal.

Think: Since block d is clear and block e needs to be on top of block d to meet the final configuration of the goal state, the action to stack block e on block d is the most direct and effective step towards achieving the goal.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block d is stacked on top of block b.
- Block e is stacked on top of block d.

- Blocks a and b are placed directly on the table.
- The top surfaces of blocks c and e are clear, with nothing stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a part of the state that needs to be considered for planning actions such as stacking or unstacking blocks, or moving blocks from the hand to the table or vice versa.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state still has blocks c and e correctly positioned, with c on a and e on d. The robot hand is empty, which allows for manipulation of blocks to progress towards the goal configuration.

Think: To further align with the goal state where block d needs to be on c, and e on d, the first step should be to free block d. This means block e needs to be unstacked from block d, making block d clear and ready to be manipulated in the next steps.

Action: unstack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five objects identified as a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is also on the table.
- Block c is on top of block a and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
- Block d is on top of block b and is also clear.
- Block e is being held by the robot hand.

This setup involves blocks placed both on the table and stacked on top of each other, with the robot hand actively holding one block.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block e, which needs to be stacked on block d in accordance with the goal state. Block d is clear and positioned on top of block b, which is separate from the main stacking sequence required to achieve the goal.

Think: The most direct action to continue progressing towards the goal state is to stack block e onto block d. This action utilizes the robot's current state of holding block e and aligns with the required final configuration of having block e on top of block d.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block d is stacked on top of block b.

This setup forms a part of the state that needs to be considered for planning actions such as stacking or unstacking blocks, or moving blocks from the hand to the table or vice versa.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has block e stacked on top of block d, which is stacked on block b. Block c is correctly stacked on block a in alignment with the goal configuration. However, to complete the goal, block d needs to be moved on top of block c, followed by block e on top of block d. The robot hand is empty, which is ready for the next move.

Think: To progress towards the goal, the first necessary step is to make block d available for stacking on block c. This requires unstacking block e from block d, which will make block d free to be manipulated into the required position.

Action: unstack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five objects identified as a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

This setup involves blocks placed both on the table and stacked on top of each other, with the robot hand actively holding one block.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block C is on top of block A, block D is on top of block C, and block E is on top of block D. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a vertical sequence from A at the bottom to E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block e, and the goal configuration necessitates stacking block e on top of block d. Block d is clear and positioned on block b, separate from the main stacking sequence involving blocks c, a, and ultimately e.

Think: Since block e needs to be directly stacked onto block d to move closer to achieving the goal state, and block d is clear and ready to receive block e, the immediate and correct action is to stack block e on block d.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state still presents blocks d and e stacked together on block b, and block c properly placed on block a. To align with the goal state, block d needs to be moved on top of block c, followed by block e on block d. Currently, the robot hand is empty, ready for the next action.

Think: To proceed effectively towards the goal state, the immediate necessary action is to make block d available to be stacked on block c. This requires removing block e from atop block d, thus freeing block d for the subsequent necessary stacking actions.

Action: unstack(e:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have five objects identified as a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block e, and block d is positioned on block b, clear and separate from the main stack. The goal requires block e to be placed on top of block d, which will be stacked on block c, which in turn is on block a. 

Think: Since block d is clear and separate, and block e needs to eventually be on top of block d, the most logical and direct step to achieving the goal state is to stack block e onto block d right now. This positions block e appropriately for future manipulation of block d.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)

Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has blocks arranged in a manner where block e is stacked on block d, which is itself on block b. Block c is strategically placed on block a, aligning with part of the goal configuration. The robot hand is empty, ready for action.

Think: To rearrange the blocks to fit the goal state, block d needs to be placed on top of block c, and block e on top of block d. The first step towards this configuration is to free block d by removing block e from on top of it. This action will make block d available for subsequent stacking on block c.

Action: unstack(e:default,d:default)

Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,c:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is holding block e, and block d is clear and positioned on block b. The goal requires block e to be stacked on block d after block d is placed on block c, which is on top of block a.

Think: Given that block d is clear and the final configuration requires block e to be on top of block d, the most direct action to align with the goal state is to stack block e onto block d. This sets the stage for moving block d (with e on top) onto block c in subsequent steps.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)

- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has block e stacked on top of block d, and block d is on block b. Block c is correctly positioned on block a as required by the goal state. The robot hand is empty, which allows for potential manipulation of blocks.

Think: To align with the goal state, I need to reposition block d to be on top of block c and block e on top of block d. The first action towards this configuration is to free block d for movement by unstacking block e from it.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block e, and the goal is to have block e stacked on top of block d, which in turn needs to be stacked on block c. Block c is already properly placed on block a, and block d is clear on block b.

Think: Since block d is clear and the final step in the goal configuration is to have block e on top of block d, the most direct and appropriate action now is to stack block e onto block d. This aligns with the goal and sets up the remaining blocks for final positioning.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has block e stacked on top of block d, which is on block b, and block c correctly placed on block a, aligning with part of the goal configuration. The robot hand is empty, allowing for manipulation.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block d needs to be placed on block c, and block e subsequently on block d. The first step to facilitate this final arrangement is to unstack block e from block d, making block d available for the next necessary action.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block e, and the blocks are arranged such that block c is on top of block a, and block d is clear on top of block b. The goal configuration needs block d to be placed on block c, followed by stacking block e on top of block d.

Think: To move towards the goal, block e needs to be stacked onto block d immediately, considering the robot is currently holding block e and block d is clear. This action effectively positions block e, preparing for the subsequent stacking of block d onto block c.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)

- unstack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves block e being stacked on block d, which is on block b, while block c is correctly placed on block a. The goal is to rearrange so that block d is on block c, and block e subsequently on block d. The robot hand is empty, making it available for manipulation.

Think: To align the blocks with the goal configuration, the first necessary step is to free block d for movement by unstacking block e from it. Unstacking block e from block d will allow subsequent actions to rearrange block d onto block c, moving closer to the goal state.

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current situation has the robot holding block e, while block d is clear and placed on block b. The goal state requires stacking block e on top of block d, which should be on block c, with block c already correctly positioned on block a.

Think: Given that the robot is holding block e and block d is clear, the most immediate and strategic action that aligns with achieving the goal is to stack block e onto block d. This positions block e correctly according to the goal sequence, setting up for the final adjustments.

Action: stack(e:default,d:default)
