Current State:
In the current environment, we have five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the configuration and status of each:

- Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block c is on the table.
- Block d is on top of block e and is clear.
- Block e is on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current and goal states, it’s crucial to strategically plan which blocks to move first based on their availability and final positions. The robot hand is empty, so actions are limited to picking up clear blocks or unstacking clear blocks from others.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block C on block D and block E on block A, I need to free up block D first since it's currently under block d. The valid action available to unstack block d from block e will make block d available to be manipulated further, which is a step towards the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, and a table. Here’s a summary of the current configuration and status of each component:

1. Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is positioned on top of Block C.
3. Block C is on the table.
4. Block D is being held by the robot hand.
5. Block E is clear and is positioned on top of Block B.

This setup involves various blocks either being on top of others, on the table, or being held by the robot hand, with specific blocks being clear, indicating no other blocks are placed on top of them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal requires block D to be below block C. However, block C is not yet clear as it has block B on top of it. Therefore, any direct action with block D concerning block C is not yet possible. Thus, stacking D on other blocks or putting it down should be done strategically to facilitate further moves.

Think: The current goal is for block C to be on top of block D, but block C is not free as block B is on top of it. To prepare the environment, block D can either be put down on the table or stacked on a clear block that does not interfere with later moves. Stacking D on E is a strategic move since E is clear and this does not conflict with the goal state requirements. This action will also keep block D accessible for later repositioning under block C, once C is freed.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

Current State:
In the current environment, we have five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the configuration and status of each:

- Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block c is on the table.
- Block d is on top of block e and is clear.
- Block e is on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, which limits initial actions to picking up a clear block or unstacking. The goal involves placing block C on top of block D and block E on top of block A. Both blocks D and C need to be manipulated, but block D is currently stacked on block E.

Think: To move towards the goal, block D needs to be freed up and eventually placed beneath block C. The first reasonable step is to unstack block D from block E. This will make block D free to be moved or manipulated further, aligning with the goal requirements. This action also keeps the robot's actions aligned with the valid options provided.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D. For achieving the goal state, C needs to be on D, and E on A. Since block D is already in hand, it's essential to strategically decide where to place or stack D to facilitate the final configuration, considering block C and E's current positions.

Think: Placing D strategically is key. Stacking D on A might seem to align with the goal of getting E on A, but it might complicate the placement of C on D. The better option is to stack D on E. This allows for block E to remain clear, and since block E is already on B, it will not interfere with future actions concerning block A. It also positions D in such a way that block C can later be moved on top of it, aligning with the goal configuration.

Action: stack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. Here is the configuration and status of each:

- Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block c is on the table.
- Block d is on top of block e and is clear.
- Block e is on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Reviewing the current state and the valid actions, the robot's hand is empty, and the immediate actions available involve interacting with blocks A and D. Since block D needs to be under block C according to the goal state, handling block D is a priority.

Think: Given block D is currently on top of block E and is clear, the sensible action is to unstack D from E. This move will free up block D, allowing it to be manipulated in future steps towards achieving the goal state. It also keeps the robot's actions within the constraints of the valid actions provided.

Action: unstack(d:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have a scenario involving five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, and a table. Here’s a summary of the current configuration and status of each component:

1. Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is positioned on top of Block C.
3. Block C is on the table.
4. Block D is being held by the robot hand.
5. Block E is clear and is positioned on top of Block B.

This setup involves various blocks either being on top of others, on the table, or being held by the robot hand, with specific blocks being clear, indicating no other blocks are placed on top of them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block D, and the goal is to have block C on top of D and E on top of A. However, stacking D on A or E right now would not directly contribute to achieving the goal state, especially since C needs to be moved onto D.

Think: Placing D on the table through the action 'put-down(d:default)' will allow for a cleaner transition towards the goal state. It keeps D accessible and clear for future actions where C needs to be stacked on D. It also leaves A and E clear, enabling future stacking of E on A without interference.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block C is on the table.
2. Block E is on top of Block B.
3. Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
4. Block B is on top of Block C.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block D is on the table and it is clear.
7. Block E is clear.

This setup involves various blocks either being on the table or stacked on top of each other, with the robot hand currently not holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(e:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to stack block C on block D and block E on block A. Currently, block D and block A are clear and on the table, allowing for potential stacking. The robot hand is empty, which aligns with the available actions of picking up blocks or unstacking block E from block B.

Think: To move towards the goal, block E needs to be stacked on block A. Since block E is currently on top of block B and is clear, the immediate action should be to unstack E from B. This action will free up block E, making it available to be picked up and subsequently stacked on block A in a future step.

Action: unstack(e:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a scenario involving five blocks, labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here is the configuration:

1. Block E is being held by the robot's hand.
2. Blocks C, A, and D are positioned on the table.
3. Block B is stacked on top of Block C.
4. Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

This setup defines the state of the blocks and their relative positions in the Blocksworld, guiding the actions needed to achieve any desired configuration.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)
- stack(e:default,b:default)
- stack(e:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal requires block E to be stacked on block A. The available actions include putting down block E or stacking it on blocks A, B, or D. Since block A is clear and part of the goal state configuration, stacking E on A aligns perfectly with the desired outcome.

Think: To directly progress towards the goal state, the best action is to stack block E on block A, as this fulfills one of the goal conditions. This move is straightforward and uses the available actions efficiently, setting the stage for the next steps involving block C and block D.

Action: stack(e:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, here is a summary of the current state using the given predicates and objects:

- There are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E.
- Blocks C, A, and D are on the table.
- Block B is on top of block C.
- Block E is on top of block A.
- The robot hand is currently empty.
- Blocks B, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This configuration illustrates a scenario where the robot can directly interact with blocks B, D, and E, and it has the potential to pick up these blocks or stack other blocks on them, given that the hand is empty.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal has been partially achieved with block E already on top of block A. The remaining task is to get block C on top of block D. Currently, block D is clear and on the table, and block C is not clear because block B is on top of it. The robot hand is empty, which is suitable for picking up or unstacking blocks.

Think: To progress towards the final goal state configuration, the next step should focus on making block C available to be moved onto block D. This requires removing block B from on top of block C. The valid action to unstack block B from block C is available and aligns with this strategy. Performing this action will make block C clear and ready to be stacked on block D in subsequent steps.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Block A, Block C, and Block D are positioned on the table. Block E is stacked on top of Block A. Blocks C, D, and E have no other blocks on top of them, making them clear. The robot hand is currently holding Block B.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current goal has been partially met with block E already correctly stacked on block A. The task remaining is to stack block C on block D. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B, which does not need to be part of any stack according to the goal state. Both blocks C and D are clear and on the table, which is ideal for achieving the goal state.

Think: To clear the way for stacking block C on block D, block B, which is currently in the robot's hand, should be put down in a position that does not interfere with the remaining actions needed to achieve the goal. The simplest and most non-disruptive action would be to put down block B on the table.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A, B, C, and D are placed directly on the table, and block E is positioned on top of block A. Blocks B, C, D, and E are clear, indicating that there is no block on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal state requires block C to be on top of block D, and block E is already correctly positioned on top of block A. The robot's hand is empty, which allows flexibility in choosing the next move. The immediate task is to work towards stacking block C on block D.

Think: Since block C needs to be on top of block D and both blocks are clear and on the table, the next logical step is to pick up block C. This action will prepare block C to be stacked on block D in a subsequent move, directly contributing to achieving the goal state configuration.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocks World environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The blocks are arranged as follows:
- Block A, B, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Block E is stacked on top of Block A.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block C.

Additionally, the top surfaces of Blocks B, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to reposition blocks so that block C is on top of block D, and block E is on top of block A. This requires the robot to manipulate the blocks using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to stack block C on block D, and block E is already correctly stacked on block A. The robot hand is holding block C, and the valid actions include options to stack C on D, which is precisely the needed move to progress towards the goal state.

Think: Given that block D is clear and on the table, and considering the goal to have C on D, the straightforward and goal-aligned action is to stack block C onto block D. This move directly sets up one part of the goal configuration, placing us closer to the desired end state.
