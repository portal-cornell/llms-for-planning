ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as "a", "b", and "c". Here is the current state of these blocks and other elements:

1. Block "a" is on the table and it is clear, which means nothing is on top of it.
2. Block "b" is also on the table.
3. Block "c" is on top of block "b" and is clear.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that block "b" is not clear since block "c" is resting on it, and the robot can interact with the blocks to rearrange them according to certain goals using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the specified configuration using the actions available to the robot hand, which include picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment allows manipulation of blocks using specific actions. Since the robot hand is empty, it can either pick up a clear block from the table or unstack a block from another.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block "b" is on "a" and "c" is on "b", block "c" must first be moved since it's currently on "b". The valid action to begin with is to unstack "c" from "b", allowing block "b" to become clear and subsequently manipulable.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The current configuration of the environment includes block 'a' and block 'b' both situated on the table and each of these blocks is clear, indicating that there is no other block on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding block 'c'. This setup forms the basis for the agent to plan subsequent moves, potentially involving picking up, putting down, or stacking these blocks to reach a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the specified configuration using the actions available to the robot hand, which include picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In this state, the robot hand holds block "c", and the goal involves stacking blocks in a specific order. Given that blocks "a" and "b" are both clear and on the table, positioning them correctly is essential before placing "c".

Think: To reach the goal state, block "b" should be stacked on block "a" first. However, since the robot currently holds "c", it should be placed down temporarily to manipulate blocks "a" and "b". The valid action to proceed with is to put down "c" and then in subsequent steps, stack "b" on "a".

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, and they are all situated on a table. Each of these blocks, A, B, and C, is clear, meaning none of them have another block on top. Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as picking up any of the blocks, since all are clear and accessible.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the specified configuration using the actions available to the robot hand, which include picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: To progress towards the goal state, the robot hand needs to strategically manipulate the blocks starting from an empty hand position. All blocks are clear and on the table, providing an opportunity to pick any of them directly.

Think: The goal is to have block "B" on top of "A" and then "C" on top of "B". Since the hand is empty, the first step should be to pick up block "B" so it can subsequently be stacked on "A". This aligns with the final configuration and provides a foundation to stack "C".

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, blocks 'a' and 'c' are placed directly on the table. Block 'b' is being held by the robot hand. Additionally, blocks 'a' and 'c' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them, allowing for potential actions to be performed with or on them.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the specified configuration using the actions available to the robot hand, which include picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With block "b" in the robot's hand, the next actions should directly contribute to achieving the goal configuration. The placement of "b" in relation to other blocks is crucial at this stage.

Think: The goal requires "b" to be on top of "a", and the robot currently holds "b". Given the valid actions available, stacking "b" on "a" is the most straightforward move that aligns with the goal configuration. This action will set the foundation for subsequently placing "c" atop "b".

Action: stack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The robot's hand is currently empty. Block 'b' is placed on top of block 'a', and both blocks 'a' and 'c' are directly on the table. Both block 'c' and block 'b' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the specified configuration using the actions available to the robot hand, which include picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration is close to the goal with block "b" already on "a". The robot hand is empty, allowing for further manipulations to achieve the final goal configuration.

Think: To complete the goal where "c" needs to be on top of "b", first, block "c" must be picked up. This action is valid and aligns directly with moving towards the goal sequence, as "c" is clear and can be manipulated.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The current state of these blocks is as follows:
- Block 'b' is clear, meaning it has no other blocks on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'c'.
- Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on the table.

This setup represents a snapshot of the blocks' configuration where block 'a' serves as a base for block 'b', while block 'c' is being manipulated by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the specified configuration using the actions available to the robot hand, which include picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block "c", and block "b" is already correctly placed on block "a". The setup is one step away from achieving the goal configuration.

Think: Since the goal is to have "c" on top of "b", and "b" is clear, the logical action is to stack "c" directly onto "b". This action is available and directly leads to the goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)
