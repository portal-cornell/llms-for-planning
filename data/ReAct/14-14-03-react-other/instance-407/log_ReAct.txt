ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The setup of these blocks is as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is also on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- Block d is positioned on top of block a and is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup allows for various actions to be taken, such as moving the blocks around using the robot's hand, given that the blocks that are clear can be picked up or have other blocks stacked on them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal involves arranging blocks in a specific configuration. The objective is to have block C placed on top of block D, and block D, in turn, placed on top of block B. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a sequence to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves four blocks on the table with different configurations, and the robot's hand is empty. The goal is to stack block C on top of block D and block D on top of block B, creating a vertical stack. This requires a sequence of actions involving picking up and stacking blocks.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block D needs to be free to be placed on block B. Since block D is currently on block A, the first logical step is to move block D away from block A. The robot's hand is empty, which allows us to use the 'unstack' action. By unstacking D from A, it will enable subsequent moves to arrange the blocks as required by the goal state.

Action: unstack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, B, and C are on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block D. This setup allows for actions such as moving block D to the table or stacking it on any of blocks A, B, or C, provided the robot first puts down block D if a stacking action is chosen.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal involves arranging blocks in a specific configuration. The objective is to have block C placed on top of block D, and block D, in turn, placed on top of block B. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a sequence to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal state requires block D to be placed on top of block B, with block C subsequently stacked on top of block D. The actions available allow the robot to either put down block D or stack it on any of the blocks A, B, or C.

Think: To align with the goal state, the best action is to place block D directly on block B. This action follows directly from the goal configuration, which specifies that block D should be on block B. This way, block D will be correctly positioned, facilitating the subsequent placement of block C on top of block D.

Action: stack(d:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The blocks are arranged as follows:
- Block b and block c are placed directly on the table.
- Block d is stacked on top of block b.
- Block a is also on the table and is not supporting any other blocks.

Additionally:
- Blocks a, c, and d are clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.

This setup is part of a task where the goal involves reconfiguring these blocks into a different layout using the robot's ability to move the blocks around.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal involves arranging blocks in a specific configuration. The objective is to have block C placed on top of block D, and block D, in turn, placed on top of block B. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a sequence to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that block D is already on block B, aligning partially with the goal state. The robot's hand is empty, and the goal is to stack block C on top of block D. To facilitate this, block C needs to be free and available to move.

Think: Since block D is already on block B and the robot's hand is empty, the next logical step is to pick up block C, which is clear and on the table. This action will prepare for the subsequent stacking of block C on top of block D, moving closer to achieving the goal state.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it, and it is also on top of block b.
- Block a is on the table and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup involves blocks positioned on the table and one block being held by the robot, indicating possible actions for moving or stacking the blocks to rearrange them according to specific goals.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal involves arranging blocks in a specific configuration. The objective is to have block C placed on top of block D, and block D, in turn, placed on top of block B. This setup requires the blocks to be stacked in a sequence to achieve the desired structure.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block C, and the goal state requires block C to be stacked on top of block D, which is already correctly placed on block B. This means the robot is in a position to directly contribute to the goal configuration by using block C.

Think: Given that block D is already on top of block B and the robot hand is holding block C, the most straightforward action to progress towards the goal state is to stack block C on top of block D. This action is directly supported by the valid actions listed and aligns perfectly with the goal structure.
