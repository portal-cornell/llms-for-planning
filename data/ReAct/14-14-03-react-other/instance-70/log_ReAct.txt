ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the situation involves four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot's hand is currently empty. Here's the configuration of the blocks:

- Block D is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table and it supports Block B directly on top of it.
- Block B, which is above Block A, has Block C on top of it.
- Block C is clear, as there are no blocks above it.

This setup involves a stack of three blocks (A, B, C in ascending order from the table) and one block (D) positioned separately and directly on the table.
Goal State:
The environment consists of blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The blocks can either rest on the table or be stacked on top of each other. A block is considered clear if no other block is placed on it, and the robot's hand can either hold a block or be empty.

In this scenario, the goal is to have block C positioned on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There are no error feedbacks, so the previous action was valid or this is the first step. I must carefully consider the current block configuration and the valid actions available to progress towards the goal state.

Think: To achieve the goal of having block C on top of block D, I need block C to be free to move, which it already is since it's clear. The next step is to move C from B, and since 'unstack(c:default,b:default)' is an available action, this is a viable step. This action will place C in the robot's hand, freeing it up for subsequent placement.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The block B is currently on top of block A, and block B itself is clear, meaning there is nothing on it. The block D and block A are both on the table. Additionally, blocks A and D are clear. The robot hand is currently holding block C.
Goal State:
The environment consists of blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The blocks can either rest on the table or be stacked on top of each other. A block is considered clear if no other block is placed on it, and the robot's hand can either hold a block or be empty.

In this scenario, the goal is to have block C positioned on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The last action successfully moved C into the robot's hand, progressing towards the goal without any errors. The current state shows that C is ready to be placed according to the goal state requirements.

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block D. Since block D is clear and on the table, and the robot hand is currently holding block C, the direct and most effective action to achieve the goal is to stack C on top of D. This action is available as 'stack(c:default,d:default)'.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)
