ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration of the environment:

- Block B and Block C are placed directly on the table.
- Block D is supporting Block A.
- Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup describes the initial state or a specific condition in the environment where certain actions like picking up a clear block or stacking one block on another can be planned based on the goal.
Goal State:
In the described environment, there are blocks and a table, with the capability for a robot hand to interact with these blocks. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and a block is considered "clear" if there is no block on top of it. The robot hand can hold a single block or remain empty.

For this specific scenario, the goal is to have block 'a' positioned on top of block 'c'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that block A is on top of block D and is clear, making it eligible for unstacking. The goal is to have block A on top of block C, which is also clear and on the table. The robot's hand is empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block A on block C, block A needs to be moved from its current position on block D. The valid action available to facilitate this is unstacking A from D, which aligns with the need to free block A for subsequent stacking on block C.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block B is on the table.
- Block D is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
- Block C is also on the table and it is clear.
- Block A is being held by the robot hand.
- Block D is positioned on top of Block B.

This setup indicates the start or a snapshot of the state in the Blocksworld, where the robot can perform actions like stacking or unstacking blocks, or putting down the block it is currently holding.
Goal State:
In the described environment, there are blocks and a table, with the capability for a robot hand to interact with these blocks. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and a block is considered "clear" if there is no block on top of it. The robot hand can hold a single block or remain empty.

For this specific scenario, the goal is to have block 'a' positioned on top of block 'c'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block A, and the goal is to place it on block C. Both actions available, putting down block A and stacking it, are relevant. Since block C is clear and on the table, it is a valid target for stacking, which directly aligns with achieving the goal.

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is on top of block C, the most straightforward action is to use the stack function directly from the robot's hand to block C, as this action directly leads to the desired goal state without requiring additional moves.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)
