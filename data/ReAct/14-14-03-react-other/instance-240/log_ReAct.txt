ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here is the current state of these objects:

- Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also on the table and clear.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table but not clear, as Block C is on top of it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup allows for various movements of blocks by the robot to achieve desired configurations.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment comprises a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there are no blocks on top of it, and the robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The ultimate goal in this specific setup is to have block D positioned on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state and goal state indicate a need to reposition blocks C and D to achieve the desired configuration. The valid actions suggest that the robot can only pick up clear blocks (A and B) or unstack C from D. Importantly, the robot hand is empty, which is a key factor in deciding the next action.

Think: Since the goal is to have D on top of C, and currently C is on top of D, we first need to move C off D to be able to manipulate D. The valid action to initiate this change is unstacking C from D since C is clear and positioned on top of D.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment currently described, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table and each is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block C. This setup allows for various actions to rearrange the blocks as needed to achieve any specific configuration or goal.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment comprises a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there are no blocks on top of it, and the robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The ultimate goal in this specific setup is to have block D positioned on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block C, which is crucial for achieving the desired goal configuration of having block D on top of block C. The valid actions currently allow for the placement of block C either on the table or on top of another block.

Think: To reach the goal state where block D is on top of block C, block C needs to be placed on the table first as it allows for subsequent actions where block D can be manipulated to be placed on top of block C. Given the valid actions, the best move is to put down block C on the table to make it accessible for further stacking actions.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning that there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty at this moment. This setup indicates that all blocks are accessible for the robot to perform actions such as picking up any block without needing to rearrange others first.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment comprises a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there are no blocks on top of it, and the robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The ultimate goal in this specific setup is to have block D positioned on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently empty, and all blocks are clear and placed on the table. This is advantageous as it allows the robot to pick up any block without restriction, moving closer to achieving the goal state.

Think: To achieve the goal of having block D on top of block C, the robot must first pick up block D, since it needs to be moved on top of block C. The action of picking up block D is valid and necessary at this stage to prepare for stacking it onto block C.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The situation is as follows:

- Block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block b is also on the table and clear.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- The robot hand is holding block d.

This setup indicates that all blocks except for d are resting on the table without any other blocks stacked on them, and the robot hand is currently occupied with block d.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment comprises a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there are no blocks on top of it, and the robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The ultimate goal in this specific setup is to have block D positioned on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal is to have block D on top of block C. All blocks are clear and on the table, allowing for direct action towards achieving the goal.

Think: Since the goal state requires block D to be positioned on top of block C, and block C is on the table and clear, the most straightforward action to progress towards the goal is to stack block D directly onto block C. This action is valid according to the list provided.

Action: stack(d:default,c:default)
