ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Each block is placed on the table. Blocks a, b, and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, block c is on top of block d. The robot's hand is currently empty.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is positioned on top of block B. The environment includes various blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The robot can perform actions like picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, or unstacking one block from another. The ultimate goal is to achieve the configuration where block C is directly on block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current scenario, there is no error feedback, so I will proceed based on the current understanding of the environment and valid actions. The robot hand is empty and needs to manipulate blocks c and b to achieve the goal state.

Think: To achieve the goal where block C is on top of block B, I first need to free block C if it is not already free. According to the state description, block C is on top of block D, which means block C is clear but not free to move directly onto block B. The first logical step is to unstack block C from block D so that it can be manipulated further. The valid actions allow for this move.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, blocks a, b, and d are placed on the table and each of these blocks (a, b, d) is clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of them. Block c is currently being held by the robot hand. The setup allows actions to be performed such as moving blocks or placing them on top of each other, given that there are no obstructions on the clear blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is positioned on top of block B. The environment includes various blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The robot can perform actions like picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, or unstacking one block from another. The ultimate goal is to achieve the configuration where block C is directly on block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action of unstacking block C from block D was successful, and now the robot hand is holding block C. The current state aligns with the next step required to achieve the goal state, which involves manipulating block C to be placed on block B.

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block B. Block B is clear and on the table, making it available for block C to be stacked on it. The valid actions currently available include stacking block C on blocks A, B, or D. Since the goal specifies stacking block C on block B, the direct action required is to stack C on B.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)
