ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

- Block C is on the table and has nothing on top, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block A, and it is clear, meaning nothing is on Block B.
- Block D is on the table and is clear, indicating nothing is on top of it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup allows for various actions using the robot hand to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block B is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that blocks B, C, and D are all clear and the robot's hand is empty, making them possible candidates for pickup or unstacking where applicable. The goal requires specific stacking arrangements, so moving blocks to achieve this configuration is necessary.

Think: Since the goal is to have Block A on top of Block C, and Block B on top of Block D, the first logical step is to free up Block A so it can later be placed on Block C. Block B is currently on top of Block A, so the robot hand can be used to unstack Block B from Block A. This action aligns with the valid actions provided, specifically "unstack(b:default,a:default)".

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, the robot hand is currently holding block B. The blocks A, C, and D are on the table. Additionally, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. This setup includes four blocks named A, B, C, and D.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block B is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is now holding block B. To proceed towards the goal, block B needs to be positioned on block D. The current valid actions allow for either putting block B down or stacking it on top of another block.

Think: Given that the goal is to have block B on top of block D, and considering that block D is clear and available on the table, the best action to take next is to stack block B on block D. This action directly contributes to achieving part of the goal and is supported by the valid actions list, specifically "stack(b:default,d:default)".

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within a classic Blocksworld environment, which includes blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', along with a table and a robot hand, the state of the blocks is as follows:

- Block 'c' and block 'a' are both on the table and have nothing on top of them, making them clear.
- Block 'b' is on top of block 'd', and both block 'b' and block 'd' are clear. Block 'd' is also sitting on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup forms the initial environment, where block arrangement and the status of the robot hand are crucial for planning further actions.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block B is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves all blocks being on the table or stacked in pairs, and the robot hand is empty. The goal requires stacking A on C and maintaining B on D. The valid actions suggest possibilities for picking up blocks or unstacking them.

Think: Since the goal is for block A to be on top of block C, and block B is already correctly stacked on block D, it's essential to avoid disturbing B and D. The robot should begin by picking up block A, as it is clear and the action is available. This step is necessary before A can be stacked on C.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot's state is as follows:

- Block B is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block C is also directly on the table and is clear, with no other block on top.
- The robot is currently holding Block A. 

This setup indicates that blocks B, C, and D are interacting with the table, either being on it or supporting another block, while Block A is in the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block B is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block A, which must be stacked on block C according to the goal state. Block C is already positioned on the table and is clear, making it ready to receive block A. The valid actions allow for stacking A on either B or C.

Think: To align with the goal state, where block A needs to be on top of block C, and considering that block C is clear and available, the most direct action to take next is to stack block A on block C. This move will place block A in its correct position relative to the goal state.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)
