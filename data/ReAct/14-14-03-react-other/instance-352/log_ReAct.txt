ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current state of the blocks and robot hand is as follows:

- Blocks A, B, and C are on the table.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block C.
- Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This specific configuration needs to be achieved by strategically using the robot hand to pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As the robot hand is empty, the actions available are limited to picking up clear blocks or unstacking a block that is clear and on top of another block.

Think: The ultimate goal is to have a tower of blocks in the sequence C on B on A on D. To achieve this, the first step is to make all necessary blocks accessible. Block D is currently on C, which is not immediately needed in the top position, so I should focus on removing D from C first.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the summary of the state:

1. Blocks a, b, and c are on the table.
2. The robot hand is holding block d.
3. Blocks a, b, and c are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. 

This setup indicates that block d is ready to be placed down, and blocks a, b, and c are ready to have other blocks stacked on them or remain as they are.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This specific configuration needs to be achieved by strategically using the robot hand to pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is now holding block D, and the goal involves stacking blocks in a specific sequence where block A is directly on top of block D. Therefore, it is essential to place block D in a position where block A can subsequently be placed on it.

Think: Given the goal configuration of C on B on A on D, the logical first action is to stack block D under block A since block A will ultimately need to be directly above D. This aligns with the next steps of stacking B on A and then C on B.

Action: stack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and these blocks are situated on a table with a robot hand available to manipulate them. Currently, blocks A, B, and C are directly on the table. Block D, however, is stacked on top of Block A. Each of the blocks B, C, and D is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of them, allowing them to be accessible for movement. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is ready to pick up or manipulate any of the clear blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This specific configuration needs to be achieved by strategically using the robot hand to pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has block D incorrectly placed on top of block A, which is the opposite of the desired final arrangement. To correct this, block D needs to be moved off of block A to eventually position block A on top of D later.

Think: To progress toward the goal configuration, block D should be removed from atop block A. Once D is removed and placed elsewhere, subsequent actions can focus on rearranging the other blocks (B and C) to build the final configuration.

Action: unstack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

This specific configuration needs to be achieved by strategically using the robot hand to pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and according to the goal configuration, block D needs to be at the bottom of the stack. Given that blocks A, B, and C are on the table and clear, the immediate concern is to properly place block D to set the foundation for the desired configuration.

Think: Since block D should be the base, and block A needs to be directly on top of D, the most logical step is to stack D on the table, rather than on any block. This will allow for block A to be subsequently stacked on D, followed by B on A, and finally C on B as per the goal state.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, all the blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are positioned on the table. Each of these blocks—A, B, C, and D—is also clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, signaling that it is not currently holding any block. This state provides a clear scenario for the robot to initiate any block manipulation actions such as picking up any block.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This specific configuration needs to be achieved by strategically using the robot hand to pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: All blocks are currently clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty. For achieving the goal configuration of C on B on A on D, the process starts by establishing the base of the stack, which is block D.

Think: Since block D must be at the base of the final stack, the first step is to pick up block D. Once block D is picked up, it can be used to initiate building the stack in subsequent actions, where block A will be placed on D, followed by stacking B on A, and C on B.

3. Blocks a, b, and c are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. 

This setup indicates that block d is ready to be placed down, and blocks a, b, and c are ready to have other blocks stacked on them or remain as they are.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This specific configuration needs to be achieved by strategically using the robot hand to pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block D, and we need to build a structure with block A on top of block D. It is crucial to position block D correctly as the base upon which the other blocks will be stacked.

Think: Given the final goal is to have block A directly on block D, followed by B on A, and then C on B, the most strategic move now is to stack block D directly beneath block A. This will set a proper foundation for the subsequent stacking of blocks B and C.

Action: stack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and these blocks are situated on a table with a robot hand available to manipulate them. Currently, blocks A, B, and C are directly on the table. Block D, however, is stacked on top of Block A. Each of the blocks B, C, and D is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of them, allowing them to be accessible for movement. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is ready to pick up or manipulate any of the clear blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B. This specific configuration needs to be achieved by strategically using the robot hand to pick up, stack, unstack, and put down the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and block D is incorrectly stacked on top of block A, which is the reverse of the desired configuration where A should be on D. To correct this, block D needs to be moved.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, block D must first be unstacked from block A. This will make both blocks accessible for the correct stacking order. Subsequently, block A can be placed on block D, followed by stacking B on A, and then C on B.

Action: unstack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal configuration requires block A to be directly on top of D. Given this, the positioning of block D is crucial as the base for other blocks.

Think: Since block D needs to be the base and block A the first on top of it, the most strategic move now is to place block D on the table. This will allow block A to be subsequently stacked directly on D, aligning with the goal configuration.
