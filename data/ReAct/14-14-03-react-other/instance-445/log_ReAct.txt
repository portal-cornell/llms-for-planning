ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five objects labeled as blocks a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these blocks and their relationships are as follows:

- Block b is located on the table.
- Block c is also on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block d is positioned on top of block b.
- Block a is on the table.
- Block e is stacked on top of block a and is clear.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating it's not holding any blocks. This setup indicates that blocks b, c, and a are directly on the table, while blocks d and e are in a configuration where they are stacked on top of other blocks. The clear status of blocks c, d, and e suggests they can be picked up or have other blocks stacked on top of them without needing to move other blocks first.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the environment consists of multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The robot can manipulate the blocks using four actions: picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on top of another, and unstacking a block from another. The blocks can either be on the table or on top of another block. A block is considered clear if there is no other block on top of it.

The goal in this specific situation is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
- unstack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration allows three clear blocks, c, d, and e, which can be picked up or moved without disturbing other blocks first. The goal is to stack block b on top of block c, which means I need to address the placement of block b, which currently has block d on top of it.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking b on c, block d must first be removed from b. This can be done by the action unstack(d, b). After unstacking, block d will be in the robot's hand, and both b and c will be clear. The next steps will involve placing d down and then picking up b to stack it on c.

Action: unstack(d:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Blocks a, b, and c are each positioned on the table. Block e is stacked on top of block a. The robot hand is currently holding block d. Blocks b, c, and e are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

The robot can manipulate the blocks using four actions: picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on top of another, and unstacking a block from another.

Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- stack(d:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block d, and the goal is to stack block b on top of block c. Since block c is already clear, my strategy should involve moving block d in a way that allows the subsequent manipulation of block b onto block c without interference.

Think: Given that the robot hand is holding block d and the goal is to stack b on c, I need to free up the robot hand by placing block d down. The most straightforward action is to put down block d on the table, as this action will not interfere with any other blocks and keeps the environment stable for further actions. After putting down d, I can focus on manipulating blocks b and c to achieve the goal.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. The blocks a, b, c, and d are placed directly on the table. Block e is stacked on top of block a. Each block, b, c, d, and e, is clear, indicating that there is no block on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the environment consists of multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The robot can manipulate the blocks using four actions: picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on top of another, and unstacking a block from another. The blocks can either be on the table or on top of another block. A block is considered clear if there is no other block on top of it.

The goal in this specific situation is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the goal is to stack block b on top of block c. Both blocks b and c are clear and on the table, making them available for manipulation.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking b on c, the first step is to pick up block b since it needs to be moved on top of block c. Picking up block b will prepare for the subsequent action of stacking it.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here is the configuration:

- Block C is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table.
- Block D is on the table and is clear.
- Block E is on top of Block A and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block B.

This setup is part of a task where the goal is to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration using a sequence of moves, including picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the environment consists of multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The robot can manipulate the blocks using four actions: picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on top of another, and unstacking a block from another. The blocks can either be on the table or on top of another block. A block is considered clear if there is no other block on top of it.

The goal in this specific situation is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand currently holding block B and block C being clear and on the table, the setup is ideal for directly achieving the goal.

Think: Since the goal is to stack block B on top of block C and both conditions are met (B is in hand, C is clear), the action to stack B on C is immediately possible. This action will achieve the goal state directly without further adjustments.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
