ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The robot's hand is empty, allowing it to perform actions such as picking up a block. Block B is placed on top of Block D, and Block A is on top of Block C. Both Blocks A and B are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them, allowing them to be moved or manipulated. Additionally, Blocks C and D are directly on the table. This setup forms a configuration where all blocks are accounted for and positioned either on the table or on top of another block.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current setup involves blocks A and B being clear, and they are placed atop blocks C and D, respectively. The goal requires rearranging these blocks. The valid actions presented are specific to unstacking A from C and B from D.

Think: To achieve the goal state where B is on top of A and C remains on top of D, the primary step involves unstacking B from D. This action makes sense as the next step because it directly aligns with one of the listed valid actions, and it helps in progressing towards stacking B on A, which is part of the goal.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Block D and block C are both placed on the table. Block D is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it. Block A is on top of block C and is also clear, indicating that nothing is on top of block A.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand is holding block B, and block A is clear and positioned on top of block C. The goal is to stack B on A and C on D. The available actions allow for either putting down block B or stacking it on either block A or D.

Think: To progress towards the goal, the optimal move is to stack block B on block A, as this matches the goal state configuration. This action is valid and directly contributes to achieving the desired arrangement of blocks.

Action: stack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block c and block d are both situated on the table. Block b is positioned on top of block a, and block a is on top of block c. Both block b and block d are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and the block configuration partially matches the goal with block B already atop block A. However, block A is on block C, which needs to be adjusted. The goal also includes stacking block C on block D, but currently, both C and D are separately on the table.

Think: To move towards the goal state configuration, the necessary adjustment involves placing block C on block D. Since block D is clear and on the table, the immediate action that facilitates future moves toward the goal is to pick up block D, preparing it to be stacked under block C.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block C is located on the table. The robot hand is currently holding Block D. Additionally, Block B is on top of Block A, and Block A is on top of Block C. This setup forms a stack with C at the base, A in the middle, and B at the top, while Block D is being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is holding block D, and the configuration of blocks A, B, and C partially matches the goal with B on top of A. However, A is currently on C, and the goal requires C to be on D. Since D is in the robot's hand, the next action should facilitate achieving this part of the goal configuration.

Think: To align with the goal of having C on top of D, and since the robot is currently holding D, the practical approach is to place D on the table, making it ready to have C stacked on top of it in future actions.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block c and block d are both situated on the table.

Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current configuration of the blocks and the goal, actions should be aimed at arranging block C on top of block D, while maintaining the stack of block B on block A. The robotâ€™s hand is empty, and both block B and block D are clear.

Think: Since the goal involves stacking block C on block D, and block D is clear and available on the table, the logical step is to pick up block D. This action aligns with the valid actions and prepares for the subsequent move of stacking block C on block D.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block C is located on the table. The robot hand is currently holding Block D. Additionally, Block B is on top of Block A, and Block A is on top of Block C. This setup forms a stack with C at the base, A in the middle, and B at the top, while Block D is being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D. The goal is to have block C on top of block D, and block B on top of block A, which is already achieved in the current configuration of A, B, and C. The next step involves correctly positioning block D to align with the goal.

Think: Since block C is already on the table and the goal requires D to be beneath C, the most direct action to facilitate this configuration is to put down block D on the table. This action will prepare for a subsequent move where block C can be stacked on block D.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block c and block d are both situated on the table. Block b is positioned on top of block a, and block a is on top of block c. Both block b and block d are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot's hand is empty, and the blocks are positioned with B on A, and A on C, closely aligning with the goal except for the arrangement of C and D. The goal specifically requires C on top of D, but both C and D are on the table.

Think: Given that both C and D are on the table with D being clear, and the goal is to stack C on D, the first necessary action is to pick up D. This will allow for subsequent actions to properly position D under C, aligning with the goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block C is located on the table. The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

This setup forms a stack with C at the base, A in the middle, and B at the top, while Block D is being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block D, and one part of the goal state is already achieved with block B on top of block A. The other part of the goal is to have block C on top of block D. Since block C is positioned on the table, the immediate task is to effectively position D to achieve the goal configuration.

Think: Since block C is already on the table and the objective is to stack C on top of D, placing D back on the table will enable the stacking of C on D in a future step. This action aligns with the goal and the valid actions available.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block c and block d are both situated on the table.
