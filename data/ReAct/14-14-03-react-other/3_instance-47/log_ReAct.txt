ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks named A, B, and C. Block B is located on the table and is unobstructed, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block C is also on the table and similarly unobstructed. Block A is positioned on top of Block C and is clear of any other blocks above it. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup allows for various actions to rearrange the blocks as needed to achieve any specified goal configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, there are blocks and a table where blocks can either be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, there is a robot hand that can either hold a block or be empty. The goal is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The given valid actions indicate that the robot hand can currently pick up block B or unstack block A from block C. This suggests that block B is clear and block A is clear with block C underneath.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, I must first free up block A by unstacking it from block C. This is necessary because the robot hand must be able to manipulate block A, and currently, block A is not in a position to be directly stacked on block B. After unstacking block A from block C, the hand will be holding block A, making it possible to proceed towards the goal state by stacking it on block B.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Block 'b' is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear. Similarly, block 'c' is also on the table and clear. The robot's hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup indicates that blocks 'b' and 'c' are ready to be manipulated, and block 'a' can be placed on either of these blocks or back on the table.
Goal State:
In this environment, there are blocks and a table where blocks can either be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, there is a robot hand that can either hold a block or be empty. The goal is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current valid actions indicate that the robot hand is holding block 'a', and it can either put it down or stack it on top of blocks 'b' or 'c'. The goal is specifically to have block 'a' on top of block 'b'.

Think: Since the goal is to place block 'a' directly on top of block 'b', and both blocks 'a' and 'b' are in positions that allow for this action (block 'a' in hand and block 'b' clear on the table), the direct and most efficient action to achieve the goal is to stack block 'a' on block 'b'. This action directly aligns with the goal state requirements without any unnecessary moves.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)
