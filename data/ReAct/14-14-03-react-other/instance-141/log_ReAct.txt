ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The robot's hand is currently empty. Block B is positioned on top of Block A, and Block D is placed on top of Block C. Both Blocks A and C are directly on the table. Additionally, Blocks B and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged in two separate stacks on the table.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback from the previous interaction, so the actions proposed before were valid or there were no actions proposed yet. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that C is on A, and D is on C. Currently, B is on A and D is on C.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block D must remain on block C, so no action is needed for these blocks at this stage. However, block B needs to be removed from block A to place block C on A. The valid actions suggest that blocks can be unstacked, which is necessary for removing B from A.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Block D is positioned on top of block C. Both blocks A and C are placed directly on the table. Additionally, blocks A and D have no other blocks on top of them, making them clear.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and block D is correctly placed on top of block C, aligning with the goal state requirements for these two blocks. Block A is clear and on the table which sets up the next steps for achieving the goal.

Think: Since the goal is to have block C on top of block A, and currently, block C is clear and on the table, the next logical step is to place block B down, freeing the robot's hand to manipulate block C in the next steps.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current setup of the environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and C are placed directly on the table. Block D is positioned on top of Block C. Each of the blocks A, B, and D is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking the blocks.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, which is suitable for picking up or manipulating blocks. Block D is correctly placed on top of block C, but ultimately block C needs to be on top of block A to meet the goal state.

Think: Since block C needs to be on top of block A, and block D is currently on top of C, the first step should involve removing block D from C. This will clear block C for stacking on block A. The valid actions include unstacking D from C, which aligns with this plan.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block B is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block C is also on the table and is clear.
- Block A is on the table and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block D.

This setup of blocks and the robot's status provides a clear picture of all block positions and the status of the robotic hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, which needs to be positioned on top of block C according to the goal state. However, block C itself must first be positioned on top of block A to meet the goal configuration.

Think: Before stacking block D on block C, block C needs to be placed on block A. Since the robot's hand is occupied with block D, the first logical step is to put down block D, freeing the robot hand to manipulate block C in the subsequent steps.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are placed on the table and each one of them is clear, meaning no other block is stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and all blocks are on the table and clear. The goal is to stack block C on A and then stack block D on C. To do this, blocks need to be manipulated in the correct order to achieve the goal configuration.

Think: The first step towards achieving the goal is to stack block C on block A. Since the robot hand is empty, the next action should involve picking up block C so it can be stacked on block A in the following steps.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Here is the configuration of these blocks and their status:

1. Block a is on the table and has nothing on top, so it is clear.
2. Block b is also on the table and clear.
3. Block c is being held by the robot hand.
4. Block d is on the table and clear as well.

This setup involves blocks that are ready to be manipulated by the robot to achieve any rearrangement goals, with three blocks resting on the table and one block in the grip of the robot.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block C, which is an essential part of achieving the goal state where block C must be stacked on block A. The setup is correct and aligns with the steps needed to reach the goal.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, block C should be placed on top of block A as specified in the goal. The valid actions include stacking block C on block A, which is exactly the next step needed.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here's the current configuration:

- Blocks A and B are placed directly on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is also directly on the table.
- Both Blocks B and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- Block C is also clear.
- The robot's hand is empty, indicating it's not holding any blocks at the moment.

This setup describes a scenario where blocks are either on the table or stacked in a simple configuration, and the robot is ready to manipulate these blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block C is already correctly placed on top of Block A, aligning with the first part of the goal state. The robot hand is empty, and the next step involves manipulating Block D to place it on top of Block C.

Think: Since Block D is clear and on the table, the appropriate action would be to pick up Block D with the intention of stacking it on Block C in subsequent steps.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current state of the blocks and the robot hand:

- Block B is sitting on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A, and nothing is on top of Block C, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

This setup involves a scenario where the blocks are either positioned on the table or stacked on each other, and the robot hand's activity is included (holding a block in this case).
Goal State:
The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or on the table. Any block that does not have another block on it is considered clear. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A, and block D is stacked on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding Block D, and Block C is already correctly stacked on top of Block A, which aligns with part of the goal. The next step is to place Block D on top of Block C to fully achieve the goal state.

Think: The valid actions include stacking Block D on Block C, which is exactly what is needed to reach the goal state as described. This action will complete the arrangement of the blocks in the desired configuration.
