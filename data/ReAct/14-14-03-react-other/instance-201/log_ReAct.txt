ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each block is positioned on the table, except for block B, which is stacked on top of block A. Blocks C and D are specifically noted to be clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, block B is also clear, which means nothing is stacked on it. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since I received no error feedback, I can proceed with the actions available. I need to consider the goal and the current state of the blocks, especially the relationship between block A and block B.

Think: The goal is to have block A on top of block B, but currently, block B is on top of block A. To achieve this, I need to reverse their positions. Since the robot's hand is empty and block B is clear, the first logical step is to unstack block B from block A, making block A accessible to manipulation.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all placed on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action successfully unstacked block B from A, and the robot is now holding block B. The goal is to stack block A on top of block B, which requires block B to be positioned first.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, I need block B to be on the table so that block A can be stacked on top of it. Currently, block B is held by the robot, and block A is clear on the table. To proceed, I should place block B on the table.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are located directly on the table. Furthermore, each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning that there are no other blocks placed on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setup allows any of the blocks to be picked up or manipulated as needed.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block B has been successfully placed on the table, and now all blocks are clear. The robot's hand is empty and ready for the next step towards achieving the goal configuration.

Think: Since the goal is to have block A on top of block B, the next logical step is to pick up block A in preparation to stack it on block B.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The blocks B, C, and D are all placed on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block A is currently being held by the robot's hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block A is now held by the robot hand, which is exactly where it needs to be to proceed towards the goal. The valid actions provided allow for stacking A onto any of the clear blocks.

Think: To fulfill the goal state where block A must be positioned on top of block B, I need to utilize the action that specifically stacks block A on block B. This is directly supported by one of the valid actions listed.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)
