ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled a, b, and c. Currently, block b is on top of block c, both block a and block c are on the table, and blocks a and b are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned directly on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows block b on top of block c, while blocks a and c are on the table. The robot's hand is empty, which means it can either pick up a clear block or unstack a block from another.

Think: To achieve the goal state of having block c on top of block a, I need to first make block c accessible to be moved. Since block b is currently on top of block c, I should first remove block b from block c. The valid action available to unstack block b from c is 'unstack(b:default,c:default)'. This action will make block c clear and ready to be moved in subsequent steps.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c. Blocks a and c are both situated on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block b is currently being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned directly on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block b, which was successfully unstacked from block c in the previous step. Blocks a and c remain clear and on the table. 

Think: The goal is to have block c on top of block a. Since block b is irrelevant to this immediate goal and blocks a and c are both clear, the next logical step is to free up the robot's hand by placing block b down. This will allow further actions to manipulate block c. The valid action to put block b down and clear the hand is 'put-down(b:default)'.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Each of these blocks is positioned on the table. Additionally, blocks 'a', 'b', and 'c' are all clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup allows for various actions to be performed using the blocks, such as picking them up or stacking them on each other.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned directly on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is now empty, and all blocks are clear and on the table. This setup allows for any of the blocks to be picked up.

Think: The goal is to position block c directly on top of block a. To achieve this, the first step is to pick up block c since it needs to be moved onto block a. The valid action to do this is 'pick-up(c:default)'.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, block 'a' and block 'b' are both located on the table and are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block 'c'. This setup implies that the robot is engaged with block 'c', and both blocks 'a' and 'b' are free to be interacted with or moved since they are clear and directly on the table.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned directly on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block c, and the goal is to place block c directly on top of block a. Both block a and block b are clear and on the table, allowing for stacking actions.

Think: Since the goal is specifically to stack block c on top of block a, the direct action that aligns with this goal is 'stack(c:default,a:default)'. This action will place block c on block a, achieving the goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
