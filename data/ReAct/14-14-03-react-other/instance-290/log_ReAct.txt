ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. All of these blocks are positioned on the table, which is specifically noted for blocks b, c, and d. Blocks a and d have no other blocks on top of them, making them clear. Additionally, block c is also clear. Block a is situated on top of block d. The robot's hand is currently empty, allowing it to perform actions such as picking up a clear block or stacking one block onto another.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is placed on top of block C and block B is placed on top of block D. This setting involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, or stacking one block on top of another. The objective is to strategically move the blocks to achieve the desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As the robot hand is currently empty, I need to choose an action that involves either picking up a clear block or unstacking a block from another. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to have A on C and B on D.

Think: Since block A needs to be on block C, and currently block A is on block D, I should first focus on separating block A from block D. The valid actions include unstacking block A from block D, which aligns perfectly with this initial step. This will make block A available to be later stacked on block C.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Hereâ€™s the configuration of these objects:
- Block B is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block D is also on the table and clear.
- Block C is positioned on the table and is clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block A. 

This setup implies that all blocks except for A are directly on the table and are not obstructed by any other blocks, while Block A is in the grasp of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is placed on top of block C and block B is placed on top of block D. This setting involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, or stacking one block on top of another. The objective is to strategically move the blocks to achieve the desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block A, and the goal is to stack block A on top of block C. The available actions include stacking block A on several different blocks or putting it down.

Think: To progress directly towards the goal state, I should use the action that places block A on top of block C. This action is available in the valid actions list and aligns perfectly with the immediate requirement of the goal state.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All blocks except for block A are situated directly on the table. Block A is positioned on top of block C. Each block, A, B, and D, has nothing on top of it, indicating that they are clear. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations such as picking up or manipulating the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is placed on top of block C and block B is placed on top of block D. This setting involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, or stacking one block on top of another. The objective is to strategically move the blocks to achieve the desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and part of the goal state has been achieved with block A on top of block C. The next step is to work towards placing block B on top of block D to completely match the goal state.

Think: Since block B needs to be stacked on block D, and both B and D are clear and on the table, the next logical step is to pick up block B so that it can be subsequently stacked onto block D. This action is available and appropriate given the current state of the blocks.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, which is a classic Blocksworld setup involving a robot and blocks:

- The robot is holding block B.
- Blocks D and C are placed on the table.
- Block D and block A are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
- Block A is stacked on top of block C.

These details define the initial configuration of blocks and the status of the robot's hand in this scenario.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is placed on top of block C and block B is placed on top of block D. This setting involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, or stacking one block on top of another. The objective is to strategically move the blocks to achieve the desired arrangement.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block B, and the goal is to stack block B on top of block D. The current state already fulfills part of the goal with block A stacked on block C. 

Think: To move directly towards the goal state from the current configuration, the next step should be to stack block B on top of block D. This action is directly available in the valid actions list and aligns perfectly with achieving the final goal state configuration.
