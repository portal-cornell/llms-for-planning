ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. The current state includes the following conditions:
- Block B is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block C is clear and is placed on top of Block B.
- Block A is also on the table and is clear.

This setup indicates that Blocks A and C are not obstructed and can be manipulated by the robot, and the robot's hand is available for picking up a block.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

Currently, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration needs to be achieved through a series of actions that may involve picking up blocks, stacking them on top of each other, unstacking them, or putting them down on the table.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: No error feedback was given, so the previous actions are either yet to be initiated or were valid. Now, to move towards the goal state, it's important to correctly sequence the actions based on the current configuration of the blocks.

Think: The goal is to place block A directly on block C. Currently, block C is on top of block B and block A is clear on the table. Before placing A on C, C needs to be clear, which means it must be separated from B. To do this, I need to unstack C from B using the appropriate action. With the robot's hand empty, this is a feasible action.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, block 'a' and block 'b' are on the table and both are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block 'c'.

Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action to unstack block C from B was successful, as block C is now in the robot hand. To progress towards the goal, the next steps must be carefully chosen based on the current configuration and the goal.

Think: The goal is to place block A directly on top of block C. Currently, the robot hand is holding block C, and block A is clear on the table. The direct action to achieve the goal is to stack block C on block A. This action is available and directly aligns with the goal state requirements.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block B is currently on the table and it has nothing on top of it, making it clear. The robot hand is empty at the moment. Block C is on top of Block A, and Block A is also on the table. Furthermore, Block C is clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of it.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration of blocks has changed since the last action. Currently, block C is on top of block A, which is contrary to the goal state where block A should be on top of block C. This situation requires repositioning the blocks.

Think: To reach the goal state, block A needs to be placed on top of block C. Currently, block C is on top of block A, so the first action should be to separate these blocks. The robot hand is empty, which allows for the unstacking of block C from block A. This action is valid and necessary to later rearrange the blocks to match the goal state.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, block 'a' and block 'b' are on the table and both are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block 'c'.

Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The unstacking of block C from block A was successful, and currently, the robot hand is holding block C. We are now closer to achieving the goal state where block A should be on top of block C.

Think: With block A clear on the table and block C in the robot hand, the direct action to progress toward the goal is to stack block C under block A. However, considering the goal is for block A to be on top of block C, I need to first put block C down on the table to clear it and then pick up block A to stack it on block C.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. All three blocks are placed on the table. Each of these blocks (A, B, and C) is clear, which means there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action to put down block C was successful. Now, with all blocks clear on the table and the robot's hand empty, we can proceed towards configuring the blocks to achieve the goal state.

Think: To comply with the goal of having block A directly on top of block C, I first need to pick up block A. This will then allow me to stack it on block C subsequently. The current valid actions allow me to pick up any of the blocks; picking up block A is directly relevant to achieving the goal.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c. The current state of these blocks is as follows:
- Block b is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block c is also on the table and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block a.

This setup allows for various actions to be performed, such as the robot placing block a on the table, or stacking it on either block b or c, given that both are clear.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

Currently, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration needs to be achieved through a series of actions that may involve picking up blocks, stacking them on top of each other, unstacking them, or putting them down on the table.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block A, which is crucial for achieving the goal state where block A needs to be directly on top of block C. Both blocks B and C are clear and available for actions.

Think: Given that the goal is to have block A on top of block C, and considering that block C is clear and the robot is holding block A, the most direct action to achieve the goal is to stack block A on block C. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state requirements.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)
