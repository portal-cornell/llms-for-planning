ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, as well as a table and a robot hand. Currently, blocks A, B, and D are placed directly on the table. Block C is positioned on top of block A. Blocks B and D are clear, meaning there's nothing on top of them, and block C is also clear. The robot hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently empty and blocks B and D are readily available to be picked up. Block C is stacked on top of block A, and needs to be unstacked before it can be moved elsewhere.

Think: The first logical step would be to free up block C by removing it from block A. This will make block C available to be placed under block B later, which aligns with the goal state. Since 'unstack(c:default,a:default)' is a valid action and aligns with our immediate need to make block C available, this should be the proposed action.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks, labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks B, D, and A are positioned on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block C. This setup allows for a variety of actions involving moving block C or manipulating the clear blocks on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is now holding block C, and the goal is to have block B on top of block C, and then block D on top of block B. Thus, block C should be placed first, either directly on the table or on another block as part of the goal configuration.

Think: Given that the goal is to have block B on top of block C, the immediate necessary action is to place block C on the table or directly under block B. Since the valid actions include stacking block C on top of another block and also putting it down on the table, placing block C directly under block B is the most effective and direct action towards achieving the goal configuration. This will allow us to later stack block B on top of block C without further rearrangement.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Here is the state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Blocks A and B are resting on the table.
2. Block C is on top of Block B.
3. Block D is also on the table.
4. Both Blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
5. Block C is also clear.
6. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.

This setup involves blocks arranged on the table and on top of each other, with the potential for manipulation by the robot's actions.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration already has block C on top of block B, aligning partially with the goal state. The robot hand is empty, which is suitable for manipulating another block, specifically block D, to complete the goal configuration.

Think: The next step should directly contribute towards achieving the goal of having block D on top of block B, thereby completing the stack with block D as the highest. Since block D is clear and on the table, the best action is to pick up block D so that it can be subsequently stacked on block B in a future action. This aligns with the valid actions provided and progresses towards the goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of the blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block B and it is clear.
- The robot hand is holding Block D.

This setup defines the immediate state of the environment with regards to the positions of the blocks and the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal state requires block D to be stacked on top of block B, which is below block C. Currently, block C is on top of block B, which needs to be rearranged to match the goal configuration.

Think: Since block D needs to be placed on top of block B, and block C is currently on top of block B, the configuration is incorrect for the goal. Thus, the immediate necessary action is to place block D on top of block C. This would not achieve the goal state directly, but it progresses the configuration closer by utilizing block D and clearing the robot hand for future manipulations. This action is valid as per the listed actions, and it effectively uses the robot's current state (holding block D) to advance towards arranging the blocks as required by the goal state.

Action: stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block B is located on the table.
2. The robot's hand is empty.
3. Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block A is also on the table and is clear.
5. Block D is on top of Block C.
6. Block C is on top of Block B, forming a stack.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with B at the base, C on top of B, and D on top of C, while A is separate and directly on the table. The clarity of blocks A and D allows for potential manipulation, and the robot hand being empty is ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of blocks D, C, and B already matches the goal state arrangement with D on top of C, and C on top of B. The robot hand is empty, which means it is ready for any necessary action to maintain or adjust the configuration, though it appears no adjustments are needed according to the goal description.

Think: Given that the block configuration matches the goal state (D on top of C on top of B), and the valid actions include picking up block A or unstacking D from C, it seems there is no action required to further achieve the goal. However, to respond appropriately to the environment's permitted actions, we should select an action that does not disrupt the current correct configuration. Since picking up block A does not interfere with the current correct stack of B, C, and D, it is a safe and valid choice.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block B is positioned on the table, and block C is stacked on top of block B. Additionally, block D is stacked on top of block C. Block A is currently being held by the robot hand. The top surfaces of blocks A and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration of blocks B, C, and D already matches the goal state perfectly, with D on top of C and C on top of B. The only deviation from a fully clear state is that the robot hand is holding block A.

Think: Since the configuration of B, C, and D should not be altered to maintain alignment with the goal state, the action taken should focus on handling block A without disrupting the existing stack. The valid actions suggest either putting down block A on the table or stacking it on top of block D. To keep the goal state intact and minimize complexity, putting down block A is the safest and most straightforward action.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block B is located on the table.
2. The robot's hand is empty.
3. Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block A is also on the table and is clear.
5. Block D is on top of Block C.
6. Block C is on top of Block B, forming a stack.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with B at the base, C on top of B, and D on top of C, while A is separate and directly on the table. The clarity of blocks A and D allows for potential manipulation, and the robot hand being empty is ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current arrangement of blocks B, C, and D already matches the desired goal state configuration with D on top of C, and C on top of B. The robot hand is empty which is ideal for any potential actions needed, but based on the goal state, no reconfiguration is necessary for blocks B, C, and D.

Think: Given that the current block arrangement directly aligns with the goal state, any action involving these blocks should be avoided to maintain this setup. The valid actions include picking up block A or unstacking D from C. Picking up block A is the most appropriate action as it does not disturb the existing correct configuration of the other blocks.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of blocks B, C, and D is in the desired state according to the goal, with D on top of C and C on top of B. The robot hand is holding block A, which needs to be managed without disrupting the correct stack configuration.

Think: To maintain the correct configuration of B, C, and D, the action chosen for block A should not interfere with these blocks. The valid actions available are to either put down block A or stack it on top of block D. Stacking A on top of D would not align with the goal state's requirements, as it could potentially disturb the necessary order. Therefore, the safest and most aligned action is to simply put down block A.

Action: put-down(a:default)

- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration of blocks B, C, and D already matches the desired goal state with D on top of C and C on top of B. The robot hand is currently holding block A, which is not part of the main stack affecting the goal state.

Think: Given that the current arrangement of blocks B, C, and D aligns with the goal state, handling block A should not disrupt this setup. The valid actions are to either put down block A or stack it on top of block D. Stacking A on top of D would alter the desired configuration and potentially interfere with the goal. Therefore, putting down block A is the appropriate action to ensure the current correct configuration of B, C, and D remains unaffected.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block B is located on the table.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration of blocks B, C, and D does not match the goal state. The goal requires block B on top of C and D on top of B, but currently, C is on top of B and D on top of C. The robot hand is empty, allowing for actions that could potentially correct the stack order.

Think: Since the current stack order is incorrect, the necessary step is to rearrange these blocks. The valid action 'unstack(d:default,c:default)' would allow the robot to remove block D from on top of block C, which is a critical step towards rearranging the blocks into the correct order as specified in the goal state. This action will make block D available to be restacked in the correct order subsequently.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of the blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal is to have block B on top of block C, and then block D on top of block B. Currently, block C is on top of block B, which needs to be rearranged to match the goal configuration.

Think: Since block D needs to be placed on top of block B, and block C is currently on top of block B, the configuration is incorrect for the goal. Thus, the immediate necessary action is to place block D on top of block C. This would not achieve the goal state directly, but it progresses the configuration closer by utilizing block D and clearing the robot hand for future manipulations. This action is valid as per the listed actions, and it effectively uses the robot's current state (holding block D) to advance towards arranging the blocks as required by the goal state.

4. Block A is also on the table and is clear.
5. Block D is on top of Block C.
6. Block C is on top of Block B, forming a stack.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with B at the base, C on top of B, and D on top of C, while A is separate and directly on the table. The clarity of blocks A and D allows for potential manipulation, and the robot hand being empty is ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of blocks B, C, and D does not align with the goal state. According to the goal, block B should be placed on top of block C, and block D should then be placed on top of block B. However, the current stack is B at the base, followed by C, and then D on top, which necessitates reordering.

Think: To begin reordering the blocks to match the goal state, we need to first disassemble the current stack partially. The valid action 'unstack(d:default,c:default)' allows us to remove block D from atop block C. This action is essential as it makes block D available and leaves block C clear, setting the stage for future rearrangement that aligns with the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of the blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block B and it is clear.
- The robot hand is holding Block D.

This setup defines the immediate state of the environment with regards to the positions of the blocks and the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal state requires block D to be stacked on top of block B, which in turn should be on top of block C. Currently, block C is on top of block B, which is inverse to the desired order.

Think: To align with the goal state configuration, block D needs to be placed in a position that doesn't conflict with rearranging blocks B and C. The valid actions suggest that block D can either be put down on the table, stacked on block A, or stacked on block C. Since stacking D on C would not help in reversing the order of B and C, and stacking on A is irrelevant to the goal, the best immediate action is to put down block D. This clears the robot hand and leaves room for further actions to correctly rearrange blocks B and C.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Here is the state of these blocks and the robot hand:

4. Both Blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
5. Block C is also clear.
6. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.

This setup involves blocks arranged on the table and on top of each other, with the potential for manipulation by the robot's actions.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has block C on top of block B, which is opposite of the goal state that requires block B on top of block C. Also, block D needs to be placed on top of block B in the goal state. The robot hand is currently empty, which allows for flexibility in choosing the next action.

Think: To begin aligning with the goal state, the first step would be to correct the order of blocks B and C. Since block C is currently on top of block B, using the action 'unstack(c:default,b:default)' will allow us to separate these blocks, making block C available to be repositioned or for block B to be moved underneath it in future actions.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks, labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks B, D, and A are positioned on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block C. This setup allows for a variety of actions involving moving block C or manipulating the clear blocks on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block C, and the goal state requires block B to be directly underneath block C, and block D on top of block B. Currently, blocks B and D are clear and on the table.

Think: To progress towards the goal, block C needs to be positioned directly above block B as the first step in creating the correct stack order. The valid actions allow for stacking block C on top of block B, which aligns perfectly with the goal requirements at this stage. By executing this action, block C will be correctly placed, setting the stage for block D to be stacked on top of block B in subsequent moves.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Here is the state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Blocks A and B are resting on the table.
2. Block C is on top of Block B.
3. Block D is also on the table.
4. Both Blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
5. Block C is also clear.
6. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.

This setup involves blocks arranged on the table and on top of each other, with the potential for manipulation by the robot's actions.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration of blocks does not align with the goal state. Block C is on top of block B, but the goal requires block B to be on top of block C, which is the opposite of the current setup. Additionally, block D, which needs to be the topmost block on block B, is currently on the table and clear.

Think: To progress toward the goal, the existing stack of block C on block B needs to be reversed. The robot hand is empty, which is suitable for manipulating blocks. The valid action 'pick-up(d:default)' aligns with the next steps towards the goal, as picking up block D will prepare it to be placed on top of block B once block B is correctly positioned above block C.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of the blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block B and it is clear.
- The robot hand is holding Block D.

This setup defines the immediate state of the environment with regards to the positions of the blocks and the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current arrangement of blocks does not meet the goal state requirements. Block C is on top of block B, but the goal requires block B to be on top of block C, and then block D, which is currently held by the robot hand, needs to be on top of block B. 

Think: The necessary step towards achieving the goal is to reposition block D in preparation for the future rearrangement of blocks B and C. The valid action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' is strategic because it positions block D on top of block C, which is currently on top of block B. This maneuver keeps block D in a position that is closer to the final goal configuration, allowing for easier rearrangement of B and C in subsequent moves.

Action: stack(d:default,c:default)

4. Block A is also on the table and is clear.
5. Block D is on top of Block C.
6. Block C is on top of Block B, forming a stack.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with B at the base, C on top of B, and D on top of C, while A is separate and directly on the table. The clarity of blocks A and D allows for potential manipulation, and the robot hand being empty is ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current stack of blocks B, C, and D does not align with the goal state, which requires B to be on top of C, and D on top of B. The robot's hand is empty, which provides flexibility for manipulating the blocks.

Think: To rearrange the stack to meet the goal, the first step is to unstack block D from C. This action will clear block C, allowing for the subsequent rearrangement of block B and C as required. The valid action 'unstack(d:default,c:default)' directly addresses this need, making it the appropriate choice for progressing toward the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of the blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block B and it is clear.
- The robot hand is holding Block D.

This setup defines the immediate state of the environment with regards to the positions of the blocks and the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This represents a specific configuration where block D is the highest in a stack that includes blocks B and C sequentially below it.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state has block C on top of block B, which is the opposite of the goal configuration where block B should be on top of block C. The robot hand is holding block D, which ultimately needs to be on top of block B in the goal state.

Think: To progress towards the goal, rearranging blocks B and C is necessary. However, holding block D offers an opportunity to either place it down or stack it on an available block. Since stacking D on top of C does not interfere with potential future actions to rearrange B and C, and it keeps D in a clear state above the rest, it might be a strategic placement until B and C can be correctly positioned.
