ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, blocks B, C, and D are positioned on the table. Block A is stacked on top of block B. Blocks C, A, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block B. The robot hand will need to execute a series of moves to achieve this configuration, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback from the previous action, indicating that the initial action has not yet been taken, and the current valid actions are correctly identified based on the current state of the blocks.

Think: The goal requires block A to be on top of block D, and block C on top of block B. Currently, block A is stacked on block B, which is not the desired configuration. To progress towards the goal, the first logical step is to free block A from its current position on block B. The action 'unstack(a:default,b:default)' will allow block A to be moved freely, which is necessary to eventually stack it on block D.

Action: unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks B, C, and D are positioned on the table and have no other blocks on top of them, making them clear. Block A is currently being held by the robot hand. This setup allows for various actions such as placing Block A on the table or on top of another clear block, or picking up another block if Block A is put down.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block B. The robot hand will need to execute a series of moves to achieve this configuration, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action successfully moved block A from being stacked on block B to being held in the robot's hand. Now, block A is ready to be placed in a new position that aligns with the goal state.

Think: The goal state requires block A to be on top of block D. As block D is clear and block A is currently held by the robot, the direct action to achieve part of the goal is to stack block A directly on block D. This action will move us closer to the goal state without needing intermediate steps of putting block A down and picking it up again.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, each situated on a table. Specifically, blocks B, C, and D are directly on the table. Block A is positioned on top of block D. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block B. The robot hand will need to execute a series of moves to achieve this configuration, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action successfully placed block A on top of block D, which is part of the goal state. Now, the current state aligns with half of the goal state, with block A correctly on top of block D. The robot hand is currently empty, which allows flexibility for the next move.

Think: The remaining part of the goal is to position block C on top of block B. Since blocks B and C are both clear and on the table, the next step is to pick up block C so it can be subsequently stacked on block B. This action aligns with the valid actions provided and is a necessary step before stacking can occur.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks, labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

1. Block B is on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
2. Block D is also on the table.
3. Block A is placed on top of Block D, and Block A itself is clear.
4. The robot hand is currently holding Block C. 

This setup is part of a blocks world where the robot can perform actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to rearrange them into a desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block B. The robot hand will need to execute a series of moves to achieve this configuration, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks as necessary.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block C, which aligns well with the next steps needed to achieve the goal state. Block A is already appropriately placed on top of block D, meeting part of the goal state requirement.

Think: To complete the goal state configuration, block C needs to be stacked on top of block B. As block B is clear and the robot is holding block C, the action to stack block C on block B is directly available and valid according to the list of actions provided. This action would immediately achieve the goal state without any unnecessary moves.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)
