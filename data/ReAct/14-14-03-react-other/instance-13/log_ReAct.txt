ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block A.
Both blocks C and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating that it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup is crucial for planning the next series of movements to reconfigure the blocks as desired, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
In this environment, the objective is to position block 'a' directly on top of block 'b'. This setup involves multiple blocks and a table, where blocks can be either stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, a robot hand is capable of manipulating the blocks, either by holding a block or being empty. The ultimate goal here is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' ends up being stacked on block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As the robot hand is currently empty, and the goal is to stack block A on block B, the immediate task involves manipulating the blocks that are already on top of these to clear them for stacking.

Think: Since block D is on top of block A and block C is on top of block B, and the goal is to stack A on B, the first logical move is to clear the top of these blocks. The valid actions suggest that I can unstack both block C from B and block D from A. Starting with block D, as it directly involves block A, which is part of the final goal configuration.

Action: unstack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A and block B are placed directly on the table. Block C is stacked on top of block B. The robot hand is holding block D. Both block A and block C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In this environment, the objective is to position block 'a' directly on top of block 'b'. This setup involves multiple blocks and a table, where blocks can be either stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, a robot hand is capable of manipulating the blocks, either by holding a block or being empty. The ultimate goal here is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' ends up being stacked on block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With block D in the robot's hand, and the goal of stacking block A on block B, the current actions should facilitate rearranging block C or allow placement of block D without hindering the primary goal.

Think: The direct goal does not involve placing block D on either block A or C. Since block C is on B and needs to be moved before stacking A on B, placing block D back onto the table (putting down) would keep the hand free for further rearrangements, specifically dealing with block C and preparing for the final stacking of A on B.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

- Blocks A and B are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is also on the table.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup represents the initial state of the blocks where some are stacked and others are positioned directly on the table, with no block currently being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the objective is to position block 'a' directly on top of block 'b'. This setup involves multiple blocks and a table, where blocks can be either stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, a robot hand is capable of manipulating the blocks, either by holding a block or being empty. The ultimate goal here is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' ends up being stacked on block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand empty and block C still on top of block B, the next steps should focus on clearing block B for the final goal of stacking block A on it. 

Think: Since block C needs to be moved away from block B to ultimately stack block A on B, the appropriate action is to unstack block C from B. This will free up block B, allowing later actions to move block A to its desired position.

Action: unstack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks B, D, and A are all placed on the table and each one of them is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of these blocks. The robot hand is currently holding block C. This setup allows for various actions like moving block C or manipulating the clear blocks on the table.
Goal State:
In this environment, the objective is to position block 'a' directly on top of block 'b'. This setup involves multiple blocks and a table, where blocks can be either stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, a robot hand is capable of manipulating the blocks, either by holding a block or being empty. The ultimate goal here is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' ends up being stacked on block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand currently holding block C and the goal of stacking block A on block B, the immediate task involves preparing block B to receive block A, which implies handling block C appropriately.

Think: Since block B needs to be clear to stack block A on it, and block C is currently in the robot's hand, the logical move is to put down block C on the table. This action will keep block B clear and ready for the subsequent stacking of block A, aligning with the goal state requirements.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table, with none stacked on top of another. Each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning that there is nothing resting on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In this environment, the objective is to position block 'a' directly on top of block 'b'. This setup involves multiple blocks and a table, where blocks can be either stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, a robot hand is capable of manipulating the blocks, either by holding a block or being empty. The ultimate goal here is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' ends up being stacked on block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With all blocks clear and on the table, and the robot's hand empty, the next move needs to directly contribute to the goal of stacking block A on block B.

Think: Since the goal is to stack block A on block B, the first necessary action is to pick up block A. This will enable the robot hand to then stack it on block B in a subsequent step.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block B, Block D, and Block C are all placed on the table and are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding Block A. This setup positions each block in a separate, clear state, except for Block A which is in transit via the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the objective is to position block 'a' directly on top of block 'b'. This setup involves multiple blocks and a table, where blocks can be either stacked on top of each other or placed on the table. Additionally, a robot hand is capable of manipulating the blocks, either by holding a block or being empty. The ultimate goal here is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' ends up being stacked on block 'b'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand holding block A and the goal of stacking it on block B, the environment is ideally set for directly achieving this objective. 

Think: Since the goal is explicitly to stack block A on block B, and block B is clear and available, the most straightforward and goal-aligned action is to stack block A on block B.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)
