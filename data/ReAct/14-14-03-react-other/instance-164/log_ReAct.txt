ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block C is on the table and is clear from any other blocks on top of it. Similarly, block A is on the table and is also clear. Block B is on top of block D, and block D itself is on the table. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. All the blocks are positioned such that blocks A, B, C, and D are clear and available for manipulation.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the given environment, choosing valid actions according to the current block arrangement and the robot's hand state is crucial. The robot's hand is currently empty, which means it can either pick up a clear block directly from the table or unstack a block from another.

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block A. Currently, both block C and block A are on the table and clear. The first logical step is to move block C, as it needs to be on top of block A. Since block C is clear and on the table, the most straightforward action is to pick up block C.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment of the classic Blocksworld with a robot and blocks, the current state is as follows:

- Blocks a, b, c, and d are present.
- Block b is clear and is placed on top of block d.
- Blocks a and d are on the table and clear.
- The robot is currently holding block c.

This setup provides a clear picture of the arrangement and status of each object, crucial for planning subsequent moves, such as stacking or unstacking blocks, or moving blocks to and from the table.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robotic hand is currently holding block C, which is the block that needs to be positioned on top of block A to achieve the goal state. The available actions include putting down block C or stacking it on top of blocks A or B.

Think: Since the goal is to have block C on top of block A, and both block C and block A are in the right conditions for this action (block C is in the hand and block A is clear on the table), the direct approach to achieve the goal is to stack block C on top of block A. This action directly progresses towards the goal without unnecessary steps.
