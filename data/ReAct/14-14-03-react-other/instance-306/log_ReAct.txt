ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:
- Block C and Block A are both located on the table.
- Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block B is placed on top of Block C, and Block B itself is clear.
- Block D is also on the table and clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup allows for various actions to be taken, such as moving the clear blocks or picking up any block that is unobstructed (clear).
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve this specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that blocks A and D are clear and can be picked up, and block B can be unstacked from block C. Since the robot's hand is empty, actions involving picking up or unstacking are valid.

Think: To achieve the goal state (A on C, D on A), block A needs to be on top of block C. Currently, block B is on C, so B needs to be moved first. Since the robot hand is empty, the first logical action is to unstack B from C, which will make block C clear and ready for block A to be placed on it.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Currently, the robot hand is holding block b. Blocks d, c, and a are all on the table. Additionally, blocks d, c, and a are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve this specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and the next steps must involve placing B in a position that does not interfere with achieving the goal state of having A on C and D on A. The valid actions suggest that B can be put down or stacked on any of the other blocks.

Think: Since the goal is to stack A on C and then D on A, block B should be put down or placed where it won't obstruct the stacking of the other blocks according to the goal. The most neutral action would be to put down B, keeping it clear and not complicating the arrangement of A, C, and D.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. Each block is positioned on the table, and no block is stacked on top of another. All the blocks A, B, C, and D are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setting allows any block to be picked up or manipulated without needing to rearrange other blocks first.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve this specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: All blocks are clear and on the table, and the robot's hand is empty. This state allows for the flexibility to pick up any block directly, which is crucial for achieving the goal state.

Think: The goal state requires block A to be on top of block C, and then block D on top of block A. A logical first step is to pick up block A, as it needs to be stacked on block C subsequently.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The blocks b, c, and d are positioned on the table and are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. The robot hand is holding block a. This setup allows for various movements such as placing block a on the table or on top of blocks b, c, or d, provided the blocks remain clear and the actions follow the rules of the Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve this specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block A, which is a critical block that needs to be stacked on block C to reach the goal state configuration. The valid actions allow for stacking A on any of the other blocks or putting it down.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block A must be placed on block C first. This placement aligns with the goal configuration where A is on C, and then D needs to be on A. Therefore, the most straightforward action to progress towards the goal is to stack block A on block C.

Action: stack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, alongside a table and a robot hand. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- Block A is on top of Block C.
- Block B is directly on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block C is also directly on the table but has Block A on top of it.
- Block D is directly on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.

The robot's hand is currently empty. This setup of blocks and table, along with the state of the robot's hand, constitutes the environment in which actions will be planned.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve this specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration already has block A correctly placed on top of block C, which aligns with part of the goal state. The robot's hand is empty, allowing for the manipulation of clear blocks or blocks that are on top.

Think: The goal is to have block D on top of block A. Since block D is clear and on the table, the next logical action is to pick up block D so it can subsequently be stacked on top of block A.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, and a table. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block B is directly on the table and has nothing on top, making it clear.
- Block C is also directly on the table.
- Block A is stacked on top of Block C and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of Block A.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

This setup is essential for planning actions to rearrange the blocks as needed using the operations of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup requires manipulating the blocks to achieve this specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current setup has block A already correctly placed on block C, aligning with part of the goal state. The robot hand is holding block D, which needs to be stacked on top of block A to fully achieve the goal configuration.

Think: Given that the final step to reach the goal state is to have D on top of A, and since block A is already correctly positioned on C and clear, the direct action to accomplish the goal is to stack block D on top of block A.
