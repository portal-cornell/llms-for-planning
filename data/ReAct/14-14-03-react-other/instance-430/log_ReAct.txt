ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these objects:

- Block B is located on the table.
- Block A is stacked on top of Block B, and Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block D is also on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D, and Block C is clear as well.

The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating that it is not holding any of the blocks at this moment. 

This setup outlines the positions and statuses of the blocks and the robot's hand, which are crucial for planning further actions such as moving blocks or changing their configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot's hand is empty, the initial actions should involve picking up a block, but given the valid actions provided, the focus should be on "unstack" actions.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block C on block A, block A must be clear, which it currently is. Block C, which is currently on top of block D and also clear, needs to be moved. The first logical step is to unstack block C from block D.

Action: unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, block B and block D are on the table. The robot hand is holding block C, and block D is clear, meaning it has no other blocks on top of it. Block A is positioned on top of block B and is also clear, indicating that there are no blocks on top of block A. This setup outlines the current configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is currently holding block C. We are one step closer to achieving the goal, as block C needs to be positioned on block A.

Think: Since block C is in the robot's hand and the goal is to have block C stacked on block A, and block A is clear, the direct action to take now is to stack block C on top of block A.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
