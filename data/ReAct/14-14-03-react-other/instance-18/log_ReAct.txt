ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. The current state of the blocks is as follows:
- Block C is on the table.
- Block D is on top of Block B, and Block D is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block A is on top of Block C.
The robot hand is currently empty. This configuration involves a stack where Blocks A, B, and C are interconnected, while Block D is on top of Block B but is directly clear.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current state, the valid action provided suggests that the robot hand can only perform an unstacking action with specific blocks. This reflects the environment's rule that the robot hand can perform operations only on blocks that are clear and on top of another block. 
Think: To progress towards the goal state, where block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D, the first logical step is to free up block D by moving block D off of block B. This aligns with the valid action available, which is to unstack block D from block B. This action will also make the robot hand busy with block D, preparing it for further moves to rearrange as per the goal state.
Action: unstack(d:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The current configuration and status of these objects is as follows:
- Block b is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block c is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is holding block d.
- Block b is on top of block a.
- Block a is on top of block c.

This setup of blocks and their relationships dictates the possible actions the robot can execute next, considering the constraints of the blocks' positions and the robot's capabilities in handling them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state indicates that the robot hand is holding block D, and the valid actions suggest that the robot can either put block D down on the table or stack it on top of block B. This choice of actions is significant, as it aligns with the robot's capability of only manipulating the block it is currently holding.

Think: The goal state requires block B to be on top of block C, and block C on top of block D. Given that block D is currently in the robot's hand, an efficient move would be to stack block D directly on top of block C, as it is on the table and clear. However, the valid actions do not include stacking D on C, only on B or putting it down. To progress towards the goal, placing D on B does not align well with the desired final configuration. Therefore, the most suitable action currently available is to put down D onto the table. This will keep future options open for rearranging the blocks to meet the goal state without complicating the current structure.

Action: put-down(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, the robot's hand is empty. Block D is clear and placed on the table. Block C is also on the table, and Block A is stacked on top of Block C. Block B is on top of Block A and is clear as well. This setup of blocks and the robot's current state reflects the organization and conditions needed for potential actions such as moving blocks or changing their configurations.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that the robot hand is empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking actions. The goal state requires a specific arrangement of blocks B, C, and D. Hence, actions should be chosen to move towards this configuration.

Think: To achieve the goal state where B is on top of C, and C is on top of D, I need to make C and D accessible for stacking. Currently, picking up D will not immediately contribute to achieving the goal state since D needs to be at the bottom. Unstacking B from A is a more strategic move because it will free up B, which is ultimately needed on top of C. This action will also make A and C more accessible for subsequent rearrangements.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Block D and block C are both positioned on the table. Block A is placed on top of block C. Furthermore, both block D and block A are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and the goal is to strategically place block B atop block C, which should then be placed on block D. The current state and valid actions provide clear options for progressing toward this arrangement.

Think: Since block B ultimately needs to be on top of block C according to the goal state, and considering that block C is currently accessible on the table, stacking B directly on C is the most efficient next step. This will partially achieve the goal state configuration. Although stacking B on D is also a valid action, doing so would not align with the goal state requirements and would necessitate further adjustments.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(b:default,c:default)' is not valid. Please provide a valid action.
Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Block D and block C are both positioned on the table. Block A is placed on top of block C. Furthermore, both block D and block A are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that my previous action choice, 'stack(b:default,c:default)', was invalid. This reminds me to adhere closely to the list of valid actions provided in the environment description. I need to consider only those actions that are explicitly allowed.

Think: Given the valid actions and the goal state, the current valid options do not directly help in progressing towards the goal state configuration of B on C and C on D, as stacking B on C is not currently an option. To continue making progress, I should place B on an available block that does not interfere with the eventual goal. Stacking B on D is a valid action and would allow me to later rearrange the blocks after adjusting the position of block C.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Block b is placed on top of block d, and block a is on top of block c. Both blocks b and a are clear, indicating that there are no blocks on top of them. Blocks c and d are directly on the table. This setup forms two separate stacks: one stack comprising blocks a and c, and another with blocks b and d.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, which means it can perform unstack actions on any blocks that are clear and positioned on top of another block. This aligns with the provided valid actions, which involve unstacking either block A from C or block B from D.

Think: The goal is to have block B on top of block C, atop block D. Currently, block B is on top of D, which partially aligns with the goal, but block C needs to be underneath block D. Unstacking block B from D would allow repositioning of the blocks to better meet the goal. However, unstacking block A from C would free up block C, which is essential as it needs to be positioned above D. Given the end goal, it makes strategic sense to free up block C first, allowing for future steps to stack it appropriately.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with predicates defining their current states:

1. Block A is currently being held by the robot hand.
2. Block B is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it, and it is positioned on top of Block D.
3. Block C is clear and is on the table.
4. Block D is also on the table.

These conditions outline the current setup and positioning of the blocks relative to each other and the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block A, and the goal involves positioning block B on top of block C, with block C on top of block D. The available actions include either putting down block A or stacking it on top of blocks B or C.

Think: Since block A is not directly involved in the goal configuration, it would be prudent to place A such that it doesn't obstruct the necessary movements of blocks B, C, and D to achieve the goal. Placing A down on the table would be a neutral action, allowing for flexibility in subsequent moves. However, stacking A on C might interfere with positioning C on D later. Therefore, the best action is to remove block A from the robot hand by putting it down, which keeps the environment open for essential adjustments to meet the goal.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block C and Block A are both on the table and clear.
- Block B is clear and is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is also on the table.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup indicates that Blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table without any blocks on top of them, making them clear. Block B, although stacked on D, is clear since no other block is on top of it. The robot's hand is not currently holding any blocks, ready to perform actions like picking up a block or stacking one block onto another.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand empty, the actions available are focused on either picking up clear blocks (A or C) or unstacking B from D. The end goal requires placing B on top of C, and C on top of D, so strategic manipulation of these blocks is essential.

Think: Currently, B is on top of D, but B needs to end up on C, which must be placed on D to achieve the goal state. To make this possible, C must be positioned on D first. Therefore, picking up C to prepare it for stacking on D is the most direct and effective action towards rearranging the blocks as required by the goal state. Picking up A or unstacking B from D does not immediately contribute to achieving the goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block B is clear and placed on top of Block D.
- Block D is located on the table.
- Block C is being held by the robot hand.
- Block A is clear and placed directly on the table.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to each other, the table, and the robot hand's interaction with them. The robot can perform actions such as placing down a block it is holding, picking up a clear block, stacking one block on another, or unstacking one block from another to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block C, and the goal requires block C to be placed on top of block D. The valid actions suggest I can either put down block C onto the table or stack it on top of blocks A or B. 

Think: To achieve the goal state, block C needs to be on top of block D, not A or B. Since block C is already in the robot hand, and the goal is to stack it on D, the best course of action would be to place C down so that it can subsequently be stacked on D correctly. I should avoid stacking C on A or B as this would misalign with the goal configuration and require further adjustments.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block C and Block A are both on the table and clear.
- Block B is clear and is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is also on the table.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup indicates that Blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table without any blocks on top of them, making them clear. Block B, although stacked on D, is clear since no other block is on top of it. The robot's hand is not currently holding any blocks, ready to perform actions like picking up a block or stacking one block onto another.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the immediate requirements towards achieving the goal state involve manipulating blocks B, C, and D. The goal is to have B on top of C and C on top of D. 

Think: Since C needs to be on top of D, and both C and D are clear with D on the table, the most straightforward action is to pick up C. This will enable me to stack C on D in a subsequent move, as was previously attempted but not executed due to the positioning of C. Picking up A or unstacking B from D does not directly contribute to positioning C on D, which is a necessary step before placing B on top of C.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block B is clear and placed on top of Block D.
- Block D is located on the table.
- Block C is being held by the robot hand.
- Block A is clear and placed directly on the table.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to each other, the table, and the robot hand's interaction with them. The robot can perform actions such as placing down a block it is holding, picking up a clear block, stacking one block on another, or unstacking one block from another to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current situation where block C is in the robot's hand, and considering the goal to place C on top of D, it's crucial to identify the appropriate actions based on the valid options available. The previous response didn't achieve the goal due to a misunderstanding of the valid actions needed to place C directly on D.

Think: The ultimate goal is for block C to be stacked on D, but currently, the valid actions do not include stacking C directly on D. However, placing C down first creates the possibility of picking it up again and stacking it correctly in a future action. Given the provided valid actions, I should put down C to potentially reposition it correctly on D later.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block C and Block A are both on the table and clear.
- Block B is clear and is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is also on the table.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup indicates that Blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table without any blocks on top of them, making them clear. Block B, although stacked on D, is clear since no other block is on top of it. The robot's hand is not currently holding any blocks, ready to perform actions like picking up a block or stacking one block onto another.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the current state reveals that block B, which needs to be on top of block C (according to the goal state), is presently on top of block D. Block C is clear and on the table, ready to be manipulated.

Think: To progress towards the goal, block C needs to be stacked on D. Picking up block C will allow for this action in subsequent steps, aligning C for its final placement atop D, which is crucial for achieving the goal. The action of unstacking B from D, although valid, does not immediately contribute to placing C on D but it will be necessary soon to free up D. Therefore, the priority is to prepare C for stacking.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block B is clear and placed on top of Block D.
- Block D is located on the table.
- Block C is being held by the robot hand.
- Block A is clear and placed directly on the table.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to each other, the table, and the robot hand's interaction with them. The robot can perform actions such as placing down a block it is holding, picking up a clear block, stacking one block on another, or unstacking one block from another to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Currently, the robot hand holds block C, which needs to be positioned on block D to align with the goal state requirements. However, the valid actions provided do not directly allow stacking C on D, which is the necessary move to progress towards the goal.

Think: Since stacking C on D is not currently an option, the next best action is to put down block C. This will make it accessible for future actions that might involve either picking it up again to stack it on D or adjusting other blocks to facilitate this arrangement. Placing C back on the table keeps our options open and avoids complicating the configuration with unnecessary stacks on blocks A or B, which do not contribute to achieving the desired goal state.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block C and Block A are both on the table and clear.
- Block B is clear and is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is also on the table.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup indicates that Blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table without any blocks on top of them, making them clear. Block B, although stacked on D, is clear since no other block is on top of it. The robot's hand is not currently holding any blocks, ready to perform actions like picking up a block or stacking one block onto another.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the current state allows for actions involving picking up blocks A and C, or unstacking B from D. The goal is to have B on top of C and C on top of D.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block C needs to be on top of D. Since block D is currently underneath B, we must first free up D by unstacking B. Once B is unstacked and D is clear, the robot can then proceed to pick up and stack C on D in upcoming moves. This action also frees up B for later stacking on C, aligning with the goal state requirements.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current state consists of four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table and are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, which is central to achieving the goal state of having B on top of C and C on top of D. The available actions include placing B down or stacking it on any of the other blocks.

Think: To align with the goal state, the optimal step is to stack block B directly on block C, as C needs to subsequently be placed on block D to fulfill the goal configuration. Stacking B on C now simplifies the future task of positioning C on D, as it will not require moving B again once it is already in its correct position atop C.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are positioned on the table. Block B is stacked on top of block C. Additionally, blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that block B is already correctly positioned on top of block C, aligning well with part of the goal state. However, to fully achieve the goal, block C must be positioned on top of block D. Any actions taken should support this final arrangement.

Think: Since block B is already where it needs to be (on top of C), the next critical step is arranging block C on top of block D. Currently, block C is not accessible for direct manipulation as it is underneath B. Therefore, the best course of action is to free block C by unstacking block B from it. This will allow subsequent moves where C can be picked up and stacked on D, achieving the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current state consists of four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are placed on the table and are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and the goal state requires block B to be on top of block C, with block C on top of block D. The valid actions allow for stacking block B on any of the other blocks.

Think: Since the final arrangement needs block B on top of block C, and C itself needs to be on top of D, placing B on C right now would prematurely lock C in place and hinder the subsequent step of stacking C on D. Therefore, the optimal move is to first prepare for stacking C on D. This can be done by putting block B down, freeing the robot hand to manipulate block C in the next move.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is currently placed on the table and no block is on top of another. All four blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty and all blocks are clear and on the table, providing a straightforward scenario to begin manipulating the blocks towards the goal state. The goal requires stacking block B on C and C on D.

Think: To move towards achieving the goal state, the first logical step is to position block C on D, as this is the foundational setup for the final desired configuration. Picking up block C will enable the robot to subsequently stack it on D, aligning with the next steps needed to meet the goal.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, B, and D are placed on the table. Blocks A, B, and D are also clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block C. This setup of blocks and the robot's status is crucial for planning the next steps to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is holding block C, which is crucial for achieving the goal of placing block C on top of block D. The valid actions support stacking C on any of the other blocks, including D, which aligns perfectly with the immediate requirement of the goal state.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, where block B needs to be on top of block C, and block C on top of block D, the first and most critical step is to stack block C on block D. This action directly sets up the foundation of the goal configuration. It is essential to execute this before stacking block B on C, to avoid unnecessary repositioning later.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, blocks A and B are placed directly on the table, and both are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them. Block C is positioned on top of block D. Both blocks C and D are clear, indicating that no other blocks are stacked on top of C, and no blocks are placed on top of D other than C. The robot hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and block C is already on top of block D, aligning with part of the goal state. The final arrangement requires block B to be placed on top of block C. 

Think: Given that C is already correctly positioned on D, and the goal is to stack B on C, the logical step is to prepare block B for stacking. Picking up block B will enable the robot to subsequently stack it on top of block C in a future action, completing the arrangement as per the goal state. 

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The robot hand is currently holding block b. Block d is placed on the table, and block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, block c is placed on top of block d. Block a is also on the table and is clear. This summary describes the initial setup of blocks in relation to each other and the status of the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, which is essential for achieving the goal. The goal state requires block B to be stacked on block C, and block C is already correctly positioned on block D.

Think: Given that block C is already on block D, the next step towards the goal state is to place block B on top of block C. This directly aligns with one of the valid actions available, which is to stack block B on block C. This action will move the blocks closer to the desired goal state configuration without the need for further rearrangement of other blocks.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)", "unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
