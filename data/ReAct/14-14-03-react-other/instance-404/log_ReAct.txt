ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here's the current configuration:

- Block B and Block C are on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block C.
- Block D is also on the table.
- Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup indicates that Blocks B, C, and D are directly on the table and not stacked on top of each other, except for Block A which is placed on Block C. The robot can interact with any blocks that are clear (A, B, D) and can perform actions such as picking up or stacking with its empty hand.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that blocks B, C, and D are on the table with A stacked on C. The robot hand is empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking clear blocks. The goal is to stack B on A and A on D, which requires rearrangement of the blocks currently in the environment.

Think: To reach the goal state, block A must be placed on block D. Currently, A is on C and needs to be moved. Since the robot's hand is empty, the first action should be to unstack A from C. This will make A available to be moved onto D after further adjustments.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld domain, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The blocks B, C, and D are on the table and are not covered by any other blocks, which means they are clear. Block A is currently being held by the robot hand. This setup indicates that each block is either accessible for further manipulation or in the process of being moved.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With Block A now in the robot hand from the previous action of unstacking it from C, we are closer to achieving our goal. The goal requires A to be directly on D, and then B on top of A. 

Think: Since the robot is currently holding A and the goal is to have A on D next, the best move at this point is to stack A on D. This aligns perfectly with our goal requirements and sets the stage for the next step, which will involve placing B on A.

Action: stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocks World scenario, we have four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The current environment is set up as follows:

- Block C and Block D are both placed on the table.
- Block A is stacked on top of Block D.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.
- Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning that there is nothing on top of these blocks.

This setup allows for various actions involving picking up or stacking blocks that are clear, and manipulating them as needed to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Block A has been successfully stacked on Block D, aligning with the first part of our goal. The next step requires stacking Block B on top of Block A. Currently, Block B is clear and ready to be manipulated.

Think: Since Block B is clear and the goal is to have it stacked on Block A, the robot's hand is empty and capable of picking up B. The appropriate next step is to pick up Block B so it can be positioned on top of Block A.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block B is being held by the robot hand. Block D and block C are both on the table. Block A is placed on top of block D. Both blocks A and C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'a'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding Block B, and Block A is already correctly positioned on top of Block D. The goal now is to stack Block B on top of Block A to complete the goal configuration.

Think: Given that the robot's hand is holding Block B and the valid actions include stacking B on A, the direct next step to achieve the goal state is to stack Block B on top of Block A. This action aligns with our final goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,a:default)
