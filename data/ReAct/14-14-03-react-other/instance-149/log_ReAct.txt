ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration:

- Block B is on the table and is clear.
- Block D is on Block A and is clear.
- Block C is on the table and is clear.
- Block A is on the table.

The robot hand is empty at the moment. This setup indicates that the blocks B, C, and D are not obstructed and can be picked up or have another block stacked onto them. Block A, while on the table, supports Block D above it.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This arrangement will be achieved by manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks. The blocks can either be placed on other blocks or on the table, and it is important that the blocks being manipulated are clear (i.e., no other blocks are on top of them). The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows blocks B, C, and D are clear and can be manipulated directly. Block D is on A, which matches part of the goal state configuration. The robot hand is empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: To achieve the goal state, where B is on C and D is on A, minimal movements should be considered to maintain efficiency. Since Block D is already on Block A, which is part of the goal state, it should not be moved. The action to focus on first should be to align Block B on Block C. Since both B and C are clear and on the table, picking up Block B to later stack it on Block C seems like the most direct and effective first step.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld scenario, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current state of the blocks is as follows:

- Block D is positioned on top of Block A.
- Block D is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
- Block C is on the table and it is also clear.
- Block A is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block B.

This setup of blocks and the robot's interaction provides a snapshot of the environment where different blocks are placed at specific locations, either stacked on each other or resting on the table, with one block being manipulated by the robot.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This arrangement will be achieved by manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks. The blocks can either be placed on other blocks or on the table, and it is important that the blocks being manipulated are clear (i.e., no other blocks are on top of them). The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding Block B, which aligns well with the next steps needed to achieve the goal state. The current state matches the goal state for Block D on Block A. The goal now is to place Block B on Block C.

Think: Since Block C is on the table and clear, and the robot is holding Block B, the direct action to progress towards the goal is to stack B on C. This action will directly contribute to achieving the desired goal state configuration without any unnecessary moves.
