ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration of these objects:

1. Block a has block c on top of it, and both blocks a and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
2. Block d is on the table and supports block a.
3. Block e is also on the table and supports block b, with block b being clear.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a scenario where blocks are stacked in two separate columns with d and e serving as bases on the table, and blocks a and b are elevated with c on top of a and b on top of e. The clear status of blocks b and c indicates they can be moved by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment involves manipulating blocks using a set of specific actions, and it's essential to recognize which blocks are clear and thus eligible for manipulation. The current valid actions suggest that only blocks b and c can be interacted with at this time.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on block B, and block B is on block D, first, I need to clear the top of block B. Since block b is already clear and on top of block e, I can focus on manipulating block c. By unstacking c from a, I'll make block a clear, which is necessary for the eventual stacking required to reach the goal state.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e, along with a table and a robotic hand. Here's the current configuration of these objects:

- Block a is on top of block d and block a is clear.
- Block b is on top of block e and block b is also clear.
- Blocks d and e are directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup involves blocks configured in a vertical stack and interactions between these blocks and the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: From the previous action of unstacking block c from block a, the robot hand is now holding block c. The current valid actions suggest that block c can be either put down on the table or stacked on block a or block b. The goal of stacking block A on block B, which itself is on block D, and block C on block A, requires careful consideration of where to place block c.

Think: The goal requires block c to be on block a. Since block a is already clear and properly positioned on block d, the most straightforward action towards the goal is to stack block c on block a. This not only progresses towards the goal configuration but also utilizes the current state efficiently by placing c where it ultimately needs to be.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration of these objects:

1. Block a has block c on top of it, and both blocks a and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
2. Block d is on the table and supports block a.
3. Block e is also on the table and supports block b, with block b being clear.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a scenario where blocks are stacked in two separate columns with d and e serving as bases on the table, and blocks a and b are elevated with c on top of a and b on top of e. The clear status of blocks b and c indicates they can be moved by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state and valid actions have reverted to the initial setup before any actions were taken. This suggests that the previous actions did not update the state correctly, or the description of the current state might have been repeated. The robot hand is empty, and both blocks b and c are clear, which means they can be moved.

Think: To progress towards the goal where block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A, a critical step is to make block b available to eventually support block a. Since block b is currently on top of block e and clear, it should be unstacked to potentially be repositioned or to make block e available for further adjustments.

Action: unstack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this scenario, we have five objects identified as blocks a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block d is on the table.
- Block e is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block c is on top of block a and is clear.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block a is on top of block d.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged in a specific manner with some blocks stacked on others, one block held by the robot hand, and some blocks situated directly on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action taken to unstack block b from block e was successful, leading to the robot hand now holding block b. The current position of other blocks and the valid actions available indicate that block b can only be put down or stacked on either block c or block e.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block b needs to be on block d, with block a on top of block b, and block c on top of block a. Currently, block a is on block d, which is correct. Therefore, the next logical step is to position block b in such a way that it can ultimately support block a. Placing block b directly on block e will not help achieve the goal directly but will allow block b to be on a stable surface, setting up future moves to rearrange it as needed.

Action: stack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration of these objects:

1. Block a has block c on top of it, and both blocks a and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
2. Block d is on the table and supports block a.
3. Block e is also on the table and supports block b, with block b being clear.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a scenario where blocks are stacked in two separate columns with d and e serving as bases on the table, and blocks a and b are elevated with c on top of a and b on top of e. The clear status of blocks b and c indicates they can be moved by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,e:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state and valid actions are identical to a previous step, suggesting either a reversal in the environment or a repeated description. Observing this, it's essential to carefully consider the actions that will align more directly with the goal state, taking care not to repeat ineffectual moves.

Think: The goal requires that block b be on block d, block a on block b, and block c on block a. To prepare for this, block b should be cleared from block e and then repositioned. Since block b is clear and supported by block e, unstacking it will make it available for repositioning onto block d, which is a direct step towards the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(b:default,e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this scenario, we have five objects identified as blocks a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block d is on the table.
- Block e is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block c is on top of block a and is clear.
- Block b is being held by the robot hand.
- Block a is on top of block d.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged in a specific manner with some blocks stacked on others, one block held by the robot hand, and some blocks situated directly on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The successful unstacking of block b from block e has progressed the scenario to where the robot hand now holds block b. The current valid actions allow for placing block b on the table or stacking it on block c or block e. To move closer to the goal, the placement of block b must be strategic.

Think: The goal state requires block b to be on block d, which is directly supporting block a. Presently, the action to stack b directly on d is not available, indicating that block b might need to be put down temporarily or repositioned to allow for the necessary future action. Placing block b back on block e doesn't progress towards the goal. Placing block b on the table (put-down) makes it available for future repositioning directly on block d.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and status of each component:

- Block B and Block D are directly on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block D.
- Block C is placed on top of Block A.
- Block E is also directly on the table.
- Both Block B and Block E are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup lays out the initial positioning and state of each block, the table, and the robot hand in the blocks world environment.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state indicates that the previous action to put down block b was successful, and block b is now on the table clear. The robot hand is empty, and valid actions include picking up either block b or block e, or unstacking block c from block a. The goal involves stacking these blocks in a specific order, and the actions taken must lead towards this configuration.

Think: The goal state needs block b to be on block d. Currently, block b is clear and directly on the table, which makes it possible to be moved directly onto block d as needed. However, to eventually stack block a on block b, block a must first be cleared. This can be achieved by unstacking block c from block a, which will also make block c available to be placed lastly on block a, fulfilling the final part of the goal state.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s a summary of the state of each object:

- Block A is located on top of Block D, and Block A is clear.
- Block B is on the table and is clear.
- Block C is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block D is on the table.
- Block E is on the table and is clear.

The robot hand is currently holding Block C, indicating that it is not empty. The goal is to rearrange these blocks according to a desired configuration using the available actions.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The recent unstacking of block c from block a was successful, leading to the robot hand currently holding block c. The goal configuration requires block c to be on block a, after block a is placed on block b. The valid actions now include various options for stacking or putting down block c.

Think: Since the goal requires block c to be on block a, and block a needs to be on block b first, the focus should be on preparing block b to support block a. Block b is clear and on the table, making it ready to receive block a. Therefore, putting down block c is a necessary step before rearranging block a onto block b. This will free the robot hand to move block a afterward.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current configuration involves five blocks labeled from 'a' to 'e'. Blocks 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' are positioned on the table. Block 'a' is on top of block 'd'. The blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', 'e', and the top of block 'd' are clear, indicating that there is no block on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, ready to execute any necessary actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action to put down block c was successful, leading to blocks b, c, d, and e being on the table, and block a remains on top of block d. The robot hand is empty, which aligns with the need for further rearrangement of the blocks to reach the goal state.

Think: The goal requires block b to be on block d, and block a to be on block b, with block c finally stacked on block a. To achieve this, block a needs to be moved from its current position on block d to eventually be placed on block b. First, block a should be unstacked from block d to make it available for subsequent stacking on block b.

Action: unstack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. All of these blocks are situated on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block A. Blocks B, C, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)
- stack(a:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Successfully unstacking block a from block d has led to block a being held by the robot hand, and now all blocks are clear on the table. This gives flexibility in deciding the next action towards the goal state configuration.

Think: The goal state requires block a to be on block b, and block b subsequently on block d. Since block b is clear and directly available for stacking, and aligning block a on block b is a direct step towards the final arrangement, the most strategic move is to stack block a on block b right now.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. These blocks are positioned as follows:

- Block A is on top of Block B.
- Blocks B, C, D, and E are all placed directly on the table.
- Blocks C, A, E, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action of stacking block A on block B was successful, and the current configuration partially aligns with the goal state. Now, block B needs to be positioned on block D, and block C needs to be placed on block A to meet the goal requirements fully.

Think: The necessary next steps involve positioning block B on block D to prepare for the final arrangement. Since block B is currently under block A and not directly accessible for movement, block A must be temporarily removed from block B. This will allow subsequent actions to move block B onto block D.

Action: unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. All of these blocks are situated on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block A. Blocks B, C, D, and E are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)
- stack(a:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action of unstacking block A from block B was successful, leading to block A being held by the robot's hand. To achieve the goal state, block B needs to be stacked on block D before restacking block A on it. 

Think: Given that block A is in the robot's hand and block B needs to be on block D next, the immediate need is to allow block B to be free to be moved onto block D. Therefore, putting down block A temporarily is necessary to free up the robot's hand to rearrange block B onto block D.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks named A, B, C, D, and E. Each of these blocks is placed on the table. Blocks A, B, C, D, and E are all clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: All blocks are now clear and on the table, with the robot hand empty. This clears the way to reposition the blocks in the necessary order to achieve the goal state.

Think: According to the goal state, block B needs to be on block D first. Since the robot hand is empty, the next logical step is to pick up block B to prepare for stacking it on block D.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, along with a robot hand. The blocks are arranged such that blocks A, C, D, and E are on the table, and each of these blocks (A, C, D, E) is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block B. This setup allows for various movements like stacking or rearranging the blocks according to the required actions.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- stack(b:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Successfully picking up block B has progressed the setup, and the robot hand currently holds block B. The goal sequence requires block B to be on block D, which is a direct step towards achieving the final configuration.

Think: With block B in hand, the next strategic move is to stack it on block D. This aligns with the goal state requirements, allowing block A to be subsequently stacked on block B, and finally, block C on block A.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block C is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table and is clear.
- Block B is placed on top of Block D and is clear.
- Block D is on the table.
- Block E is on the table and is clear.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. This setup is ready for operations such as moving the blocks to achieve a specific configuration using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action to stack block B on block D was effective, aligning part of the configuration with the goal state. The robot hand is currently empty, which allows for the next critical steps in block manipulation.

Think: The goal state requires block A to be on block B. Since block B is already correctly placed on block D and is clear, the immediate next step is to pick up block A to prepare it for stacking on block B. This action will directly progress towards achieving the desired goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are five blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e. The configuration of these blocks and the robot's hand is as follows:
- Block c is placed on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block a.
- Block b is stacked on top of block d, and block b itself is clear.
- Block d is on the table.
- Block e is also on the table and is clear.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Successfully picking up block A allows for its strategic placement to achieve the goal state configuration. The robot hand is currently holding block A, which needs to be placed on block B to progress towards the final setup.

Think: Given that block B is already correctly positioned on block D and is clear, the most direct action to further align with the goal is to stack block A on block B. This will set the stage for placing block C on block A, completing the required configuration.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are five blocks named A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block C is on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block D is on the table and no other block is above it, making it clear.
- Block E is also on the table and is clear.
- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A is stacked on top of Block B and is clear.
- The robot's hand is empty at this moment.

This setup highlights that some blocks are directly on the table (C, D, E), while others are stacked (A on B, B on D). All blocks that aren't covered by another block are clear, and the robot hand is available for operations like picking up or moving blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The configuration of blocks is very close to the goal state, with blocks A and B already correctly stacked, and block B properly on block D. The remaining action needed is to place block C on top of block A to complete the configuration as per the goal.

Think: Since block C is clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty, the straightforward step is to pick up block C. This will prepare it to be stacked on block A, which is the final step needed to achieve the goal state configuration.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld scenario, we have five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. The arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:

1. Block d is on the table.
2. Block e is on the table and is clear (nothing is on top of it).
3. The robot is holding block c.
4. Block b has block a on top of it.
5. Block a is clear (nothing is on top of it).

This setup indicates that blocks d and e are directly on the table, block c is being held by the robot, and blocks a and b form a stack, with b at the bottom and a on top, both of which are clear.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block B, block B is on block D, and block C is on block A. This creates a specific configuration of blocks stacked in a particular order.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,e:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand holding block c aligns well with the final requirement of the goal state, which is to place block c on block a. Currently, blocks a and b are already stacked correctly (a on b), and the setup is nearing completion with only the final placement of block c needed.

Think: Given that the desired goal state requires block c to be stacked on block a, and considering block a is clear and part of the top of the existing stack with block b, the direct action to fulfill the goal configuration is to stack block c on block a.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
