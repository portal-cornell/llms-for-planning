ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block D is not on the table but is instead on top of Block C, and it is clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves blocks stacked in a specific order and the robot's hand being free, ready to manipulate the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration change will involve utilizing a robot hand that can execute actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to achieve the desired arrangement from whatever the initial configuration might be.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: From the initial configuration and the valid actions provided, the robot can either pick up block A from the table or unstack block D from block C. Since the goal is to have block D on top of block A, unstacking block D first is a necessary step.

Think: Since block D needs to be placed on block A and block D is currently on top of block C, the first logical action is to unstack block D from block C. This will make block D available for subsequent stacking actions and free up block C, which is also part of the goal configuration.

Action: unstack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:
- Block A is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block B but has nothing on it, which makes Block C clear.
- Block D is currently being held by the robot hand.

This setup is part of a scenario where the robot can interact with these blocks, either by stacking them, unstacking them, picking them up, or putting them down, aiming to achieve a specific arrangement of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration change will involve utilizing a robot hand that can execute actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to achieve the desired arrangement from whatever the initial configuration might be.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block D, and the goal is to stack block D on top of block A. The valid actions allow for this exact move without needing to first put down block D, simplifying the steps to reach the goal.

Think: Given the goal and the current state of the blocks, stacking block D directly onto block A is the most efficient move. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state requirements and utilizes the robot hand's current status (holding block D).
