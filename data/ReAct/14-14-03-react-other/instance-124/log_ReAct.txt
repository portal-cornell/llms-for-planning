ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Hereâ€™s the configuration of these objects:

- Blocks B, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Block A is stacked on top of block B.
- The top surfaces of blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. 

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks in relation to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block C placed on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since the robot hand is empty, the valid actions are focused on changing the state of blocks C and D (which are free to pick up) and block A (which can be unstacked from block B).

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block A. Block A is currently on block B and needs to be clear to have C stacked on it. The first logical step is to free block A by unstacking it from B, since block C cannot be directly stacked atop A in its current state.

Action: unstack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The blocks B, C, and D are on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Block A is currently being held by the robot's hand. This setup allows for various actions to be performed, such as placing block A on the table or on top of any of the clear blocks, or picking up another block if block A is put down first.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block C placed on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block A, and the goal requires block A to be placed on the table or another block before block C can be stacked on it. The available actions suggest different placements for block A.

Think: To achieve the goal of having block C on top of block A, block A needs to be placed in a position where block C can be subsequently stacked on it. Since stacking A directly on C would not meet the goal state, the best move is to place A on the table, thereby freeing it up for C to be stacked on it in a future action.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block C placed on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and all blocks are clear and placed on the table. This allows for any block to be picked up. The ultimate goal is to stack block C on block A.

Think: To facilitate the stacking of block C on block A, the first step is to pick up block C. Once block C is in the robot's hand, future actions can focus on how to properly position block A to then stack C on top of it.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the summary of their states:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Blocks A, B, and D are also clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block C.

This setup indicates that all blocks except C are positioned on the table without any other blocks stacked on top of them, while block C is in the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to have block C placed on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is holding block C, and the goal is to have block C placed on top of block A. Current valid actions allow placing C either on the table or on any of the blocks, including A.

Think: Since the goal specifically requires block C to be stacked on top of block A and block A is conveniently clear and ready for stacking, the direct and most efficient action to achieve the goal state is to stack C on A.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
