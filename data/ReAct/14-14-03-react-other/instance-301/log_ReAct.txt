ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration and status of each object are as follows:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on the table and is unobstructed (clear).
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A and is also unobstructed (clear).
- Block D is on the table and is unobstructed (clear).

Moreover, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating that it is not holding any of the blocks. The setup is ready for the robot to perform actions such as picking up a clear block or stacking one block onto another.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The current goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is directly on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific configuration where B is stacked on C, and C is stacked on D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment involves moving blocks using a robot hand to achieve specific configurations. The robot's actions must be chosen carefully to comply with the constraints of blocks' positions and clear states.

Think: To achieve the goal state of B on C and C on D, I need to first clear the way to manipulate C and D appropriately. Currently, C is on A and needs to be moved. Since the robot hand is empty and C is clear, I can unstack C from A. This will allow me to later manipulate D and eventually stack C on it.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, which consists of blocks (a, b, c, d), a table, and a robot hand, the current configuration is as follows:
- Blocks a, b, and d are on the table.
- Blocks a, b, and d are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup is part of a blocks world where the goal typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The current goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is directly on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific configuration where B is stacked on C, and C is stacked on D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand now holds block C, which is a key component in achieving the goal configuration. Properly placing C will allow subsequent actions to stack B on C and C on D as required to meet the goal state.

Think: The goal is to have B on C and C on D. Since the robot hand is currently holding C and block D is clear, the immediate action should be to stack C on D. This will set the foundation for stacking B on C afterwards, aligning with the goal configuration.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, each positioned on a table. The blocks A and B are clear, meaning they have no other blocks on top of them. Block C is not only clear but is also positioned on top of block D. The robot's hand is empty at this moment, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The current goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is directly on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific configuration where B is stacked on C, and C is stacked on D.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: We are progressing towards the goal state where block C is already correctly placed on block D. The next critical step is to position block B on top of block C to meet the goal configuration.

Think: Currently, block B is clear and can be manipulated by the robot hand. Since the goal is to stack B on C, and C is already in position on D, the immediate task should be to pick up block B so that it can be stacked atop C.

Action: pick-up(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described scenario, we have a robot hand manipulating four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. Block D is positioned on the table and is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of it. Block C is clear and is located on top of block D. Block A is also on the table and clear. This setup implies that blocks A and D are directly on the table without any blocks above them, block C is stacked on block D, and the robot's hand is occupied with block B.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The current goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is directly on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D. This setup involves moving blocks to achieve the specific configuration where B is stacked on C, and C is stacked on D.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With block C properly positioned on D, the next step involves placing block B, which the robot hand currently holds, atop block C to align with the goal configuration of B on C and C on D.

Think: Since block B is already in the robot hand and the goal is for B to be stacked on C, the most direct action to progress towards the goal state is to stack B on C. This action will directly create the desired configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
