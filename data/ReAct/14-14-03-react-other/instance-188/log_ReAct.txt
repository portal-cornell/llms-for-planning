ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. The robot's hand is currently empty.
2. Block D is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
3. Block A is also on the table.
4. Block B is on top of Block C.
5. Block C is on top of Block A and is clear, indicating that no block is on top of C.

This configuration sets up a scenario where the robot can manipulate these blocks, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking, to achieve any desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current configuration, the robot hand is empty, which means it can pick up clear blocks or unstack blocks that are on top of others. The goal is to stack block D on top of block A. To achieve this, block C, which is currently on block A, must be moved. 

Think: Given the goal is to have block D on top of block A, and considering that block C is currently on block A, the first logical step is to remove block C from block A. The valid action available to achieve this is to unstack block B from block C, which will make block C clear and movable. After unstacking B from C, the robot can then move block C and make block A clear for block D to be placed on it.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's a summary of the state of these blocks:

- Block d is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block a is also on the table and is clear.
- Block c is placed on top of block a and is clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding block b.

This setup shows that blocks a, c, and d are not being held by the robot hand and are in stable positions either on the table or on top of another block, while block b is actively being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state indicates that the robot hand is holding block B, and the goal is to stack block D on top of block A. However, block C is currently on top of block A, which means block A is not clear and block D cannot be directly placed on it yet.

Think: To move towards the goal, block C needs to be made clear for block D, and block A also needs to be clear. Since the robot is currently holding block B and one of the valid actions is to stack block B on block D, this action helps in progressing towards the goal by making block A clear. After stacking B on D, block A will be free for block D to be placed on it in subsequent moves.

Action: stack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand involved in manipulation tasks. The current state of the environment can be summarized as follows:

1. The robot's hand is empty.
2. Block C is clear with nothing on top of it.
3. Block D is on the table.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block A is on the table.
6. Block B is on top of Block D.
7. Block B is clear with nothing on top of it.

This setup indicates that both Blocks B and C are clear and can be moved by the robot. Block A supports C, and Block D supports B, with both A and D directly on the table. The robot is currently not holding any blocks, indicating readiness to pick up either Block B or C.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to place block D on top of block A. Currently, block C is on top of block A, preventing this arrangement. Block B is stacked on block D, which does not immediately impede the goal but may need rearrangement for optimal manipulation.

Think: To clear the way for placing block D on block A, block C must be removed from atop block A. The robot hand is empty, making it possible to perform an unstack action. Unstacking block C from block A will make block A clear, which is necessary for achieving the goal state.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. The block b is on top of block d, and both blocks b and a are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. Block d and block a are on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block c. This setup involves direct interactions with blocks, where they can be picked up, stacked, or moved around to achieve specific configurations.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to stack block D on top of block A. Currently, the robot hand is holding block C. Block A is clear and on the table, which offers a direct opportunity to work towards the goal, considering block D's current position is also on the table but obstructed by block B.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block D on block A, it's necessary to clear the path by ensuring block A remains accessible. Since block C is in the robot's hand and can be stacked directly on block A, this action would make use of the clear status of block A and prepare for future moves to rearrange block D accordingly.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand involved in manipulation tasks. The current state of the environment can be summarized as follows:

1. The robot's hand is empty.
2. Block C is clear with nothing on top of it.
3. Block D is on the table.
4. Block C is on top of Block A.
5. Block A is on the table.
6. Block B is on top of Block D.
7. Block B is clear with nothing on top of it.

This setup indicates that both Blocks B and C are clear and can be moved by the robot. Block A supports C, and Block D supports B, with both A and D directly on the table. The robot is currently not holding any blocks, indicating readiness to pick up either Block B or C.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to stack block D on top of block A. To facilitate this, block A needs to be clear. However, block C is currently on top of block A, obstructing the goal. The robot hand is empty and ready to perform an action.

Think: The optimal move to progress towards the goal involves clearing block A so that block D can be eventually placed on it. Since block C is on top of block A and is clear, the immediate action should be to remove block C from block A. This will make block A clear and ready to have block D stacked onto it in future moves.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. The block b is on top of block d, and both blocks b and a are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. Block d and block a are on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block c. This setup involves direct interactions with blocks, where they can be picked up, stacked, or moved around to achieve specific configurations.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A. The robot hand holds block C, which needs to be placed strategically to facilitate the eventual placement of block D on block A. Block A is clear and available to receive another block.

Think: Since block D needs to be positioned on block A, it's important to maintain block A's clear status or prepare it to directly receive block D in upcoming moves. Placing block C on block A now could block block A from receiving block D without further rearrangement. However, putting block C down or stacking it on another block that doesnâ€™t involve block A directly could keep block A clear for block D to be positioned on it in subsequent moves.

Action: put-down(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment featuring blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, as well as a table and a robot hand, the current state includes the following configurations:

- Blocks C and A are positioned directly on the table.
- Block B is placed on top of Block D.
- Blocks C, A, and B are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
- Block D is also on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any block.

This setup describes the initial or a specific state of the blocks with respect to their positions and the status of the robot hand within the classic Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current goal is to stack block D on top of block A. Currently, both block A and block D are on the table and are clear, which is ideal for accomplishing the objective. The robot hand is empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: To achieve the goal, block D needs to be positioned on top of block A. Since block A is already clear and on the table, the robot should prepare block D to be moved onto block A. To do this, block B, which is currently on top of block D, must be removed. This will make block D clear and ready to be moved directly onto block A in subsequent actions.

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, the robot hand is currently holding block B. The blocks A, C, and D are all positioned on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. These blocks and the robot's current status with block B are essential elements in planning movements such as stacking or unstacking these blocks to reach a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to stack block D on top of block A. Currently, block B is in the robot hand, and blocks A, C, and D are clear on the table. To move towards the goal, block D should be prepared to be stacked onto block A, which is already clear and ready to receive block D.

Think: Since block D needs to be directly placed on block A, and block D is already clear, the robot should focus on actions that do not interfere with this ultimate goal. Currently holding block B, the robot should either place it down on the table or stack it on another block that doesn't disrupt the final configuration needed for the goal. Placing B down would keep all blocks clear and potentially simplify the next steps towards achieving the goal.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal requires block D to be stacked on top of block A. Currently, both blocks D and A are clear and on the table. The robot hand is empty, making it possible to pick up any block.

Think: To directly work towards the goal, the robot should pick up block D since it needs to be stacked on block A. By picking up block D, the robot can prepare for the next action to stack it directly onto A, aligning perfectly with the goal state.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment within the Blocksworld domain, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and C are positioned on the table and are clear, which means there are no other blocks on top of them. Block D is currently being held by the robot hand. This setup allows for potential actions such as moving block D to the top of any of the clear blocks on the table or putting it down on the table.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block D positioned on top of block A.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The goal is to stack block D on top of block A. The robot is currently holding block D, and block A is clear on the table, which positions the environment perfectly to achieve the goal directly.

Think: Since block D is already in the robot's hand and block A is clear and ready to receive block D, the most straightforward and goal-oriented action is to stack block D directly onto block A. This action aligns with the goal state without requiring any additional rearrangements.
