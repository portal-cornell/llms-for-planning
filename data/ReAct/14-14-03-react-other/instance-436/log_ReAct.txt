ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here's the current configuration of these objects:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is also on the table and it is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A and is clear as well.
- Block D is on the table and is clear.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup provides a clear overview of the positions of each block and the status of the robot's hand, important for planning the next actions in the Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current goal is to have block A placed on top of block B. This setup involves multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The blocks can either be stacked on each other or placed on the table, and each block must be clear (i.e., have nothing on it) to be moved. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty. The ultimate objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial configuration of blocks and the robot's capabilities allow for picking up or unstacking certain blocks directly. It is crucial to identify which blocks need to be moved to achieve the goal state and in what sequence, considering the robot hand can hold only one block at a time.

Think: Block C is currently on top of Block A, which needs to be placed on Block B to achieve the goal. First, I need to clear Block A by removing Block C. The valid action available for this is unstacking C from A. After unstacking C, the next steps will involve handling Block A and B appropriately, but the immediate concern is to free up Block A.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup is as follows:

- Blocks A, B, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Each of the blocks A, B, and D is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block C.

This setup allows for actions such as moving block C to either the table or on top of one of the clear blocks A, B, or D. Additional actions can involve picking up any of the clear blocks (A, B, or D) since they are unobstructed.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current goal is to have block A placed on top of block B. This setup involves multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The blocks can either be stacked on each other or placed on the table, and each block must be clear (i.e., have nothing on it) to be moved. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty. The ultimate objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that Block C has been successfully unstacked from Block A and is now held by the robot's hand. The goal is to stack Block A on top of Block B, which means Block A needs to be free to move and Block B should be clear to receive Block A.

Think: Given that Blocks A, B, and D are clear and on the table, and Block C is in the robotâ€™s hand, the immediate concern is to place Block C without obstructing Block A or B. Placing C on Block D would be a strategic move as it keeps both A and B accessible for the next steps required to achieve the goal. After placing C, Block A can be picked up and then placed on Block B.

Action: stack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Blocks A and B are on the table and they are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- Block C is placed on top of Block D, and Block C is also clear.
- Block D is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This summarizes the state of all objects and their relationships in the environment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current goal is to have block A placed on top of block B. This setup involves multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The blocks can either be stacked on each other or placed on the table, and each block must be clear (i.e., have nothing on it) to be moved. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty. The ultimate objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that both Block A and Block B are clear and on the table, which is ideal for achieving the goal of stacking Block A on top of Block B. The robot hand is empty, which allows for picking up a block directly.

Think: To achieve the goal state where Block A is on top of Block B, the first step is to pick up Block A since it is clear and accessible. Once Block A is in the robot's hand, the subsequent action would be to stack it on Block B.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration of these objects:
- Block B is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block D is also on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block A.
- Block C is clear, meaning no blocks are stacked on top of it.

This setup indicates that Blocks B and C are clear and can have other blocks placed on them. Meanwhile, Block A is in the robot's hand, ready to be placed down or stacked, and Block D is supporting Block C.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current goal is to have block A placed on top of block B. This setup involves multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks. The blocks can either be stacked on each other or placed on the table, and each block must be clear (i.e., have nothing on it) to be moved. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty. The ultimate objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is directly on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand currently holds Block A, which is precisely the block needed to be placed on Block B to achieve the goal state. Block B is clear and ready to receive Block A, aligning perfectly with the required final configuration.

Think: Given that Block B is clear and the goal is to stack Block A on top of Block B, the most direct and effective action to take is to stack Block A on Block B. This action directly leads to the goal state without any unnecessary steps.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)
