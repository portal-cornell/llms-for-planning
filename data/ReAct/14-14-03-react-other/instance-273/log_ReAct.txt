ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the objects consist of four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration of these blocks and other conditions are as follows:
- Block b is on the table.
- The robot's hand is empty.
- Block b is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block d is also on the table.
- Block c is placed on top of block d.
- Block a is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block a is placed on top of block c.

This setup involves blocks stacked upon each other and some resting on the table, with the robot hand currently not holding any blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The objects involved are blocks labeled as "a" and "b," among possibly others. The robot hand can manipulate these blocks by picking them up, putting them down, or stacking them on each other or on the table.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks such that block "a" is positioned on top of block "b." This configuration requires that block "b" is clear (nothing is on top of it) and block "a" can be moved by the robot hand to be stacked on block "b." The actions available to achieve this are picking up block "a" if it is clear and the robot hand is empty, and then stacking it on block "b." If block "a" is not clear or the robot hand is not empty, other actions such as unstacking or putting down blocks might be necessary first to achieve the goal configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current scenario, the robot hand is empty, and block a, which we ultimately need to place on block b, is currently on top of block c. Block b is clear and on the table, suitable for stacking block a upon it once block a is free.

Think: Since the robot hand is empty and block a is not directly accessible for pick-up due to it being on top of block c, the first logical step is to unstack block a from block c. This will make block a free to be manipulated further, either by picking it up directly if needed or preparing for the next steps towards achieving the goal state.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocks World environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

- Block B is on the table and has nothing on top, making it clear.
- Block D is also on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block D, and Block C itself is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block A.

This setup involves various block positions relative to each other and the table, and the status of each block in terms of being clear or held.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The objects involved are blocks labeled as "a" and "b," among possibly others. The robot hand can manipulate these blocks by picking them up, putting them down, or stacking them on each other or on the table.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks such that block "a" is positioned on top of block "b."

The actions available to achieve this are picking up block "a" if it is clear and the robot hand is empty, and then stacking it on block "b." If block "a" is not clear or the robot hand is not empty, other actions such as unstacking or putting down blocks might be necessary first to achieve the goal configuration.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is now holding block a, and block b is clear and available on the table. This situation is advantageous as it aligns perfectly with our goal to place block a on top of block b.

Think: Since our goal state requires block a to be stacked directly on block b, and block b is clear with no other blocks on top, the most straightforward action is to use the 'stack' command. Block a is already being held by the robot hand, and the valid actions include the option to stack block a on block b.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)
