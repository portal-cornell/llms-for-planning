ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the robot's hand is empty. The blocks are arranged as follows:
- Block b is placed on top of block d, and block d is directly on the table.
- Block a is placed on top of block c, and block c is directly on the table.
- Both blocks a and b are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current valid actions suggest that the robot can only unstack blocks that are clear and on top of another block. As the robot's hand is empty, picking up or unstacking a block is necessary before any stacking can occur.

Think: To achieve the goal state of block C on top of block B and block D on top of block C, I need to rearrange the blocks. The first step is to free up block C by unstacking block A from it.

Action: unstack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The block A is currently being held by the robot's hand. Block B is positioned on top of block D, and both blocks C and D are situated on the table. Blocks B and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is currently holding block A, and the actions available indicate that A can either be put down on the table or stacked on top of blocks B or C. Considering the goal, my actions should focus on repositioning the blocks towards achieving that configuration.

Think: To move towards the goal state, block C must be clear to eventually stack block D on top of it. Since block C is already clear and on the table, my immediate action should not involve disturbing block C with A. Instead, I can put down block A back on the table, freeing the robot's hand for future moves that align directly with achieving the goal configuration.

Action: put-down(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block C is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
- Block A is also on the table and clear, with no other blocks on top.
- Block B is clear and placed on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup forms the initial state of the blocks, which can be modified through the actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks as needed.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the actions available involve picking up blocks A and C, or unstacking block B from D. To achieve the goal state, block B needs to be clear to eventually place block C on top of it.

Think: Since block B is currently on top of block D, the first logical step is to remove block B from block D. This action will make block B clear and ready to be part of the foundation of the desired stack with block C on top of it. 

Action: unstack(b:default,d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand currently holding block B and all other blocks clear and on the table, the next step should be focused on positioning block B correctly to align with the goal state configuration.

Think: The goal state requires block C to be directly beneath block B. Since block C is clear and on the table, the best move at this point is to stack block B on top of block C. This action directly contributes to achieving part of the goal configuration.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and these blocks interact with each other and the table in the following ways:

- Block C is on the table.
- Block A is also on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is on top of Block C and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of B.
- Block D is on the table and is clear as well.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. This setup provides various options for the robot to manipulate the blocks, such as picking up any of the clear blocks or stacking them differently, provided the robot hand is free.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current configuration and the goal state, it's clear that the positioning of blocks B and C needs to be adjusted since the goal requires C to be on top of B, but currently B is on top of C. The robot's hand is empty, which gives the flexibility to manipulate blocks directly.

Think: To progress towards the goal, block B needs to be removed from on top of C so that C can later be stacked on B. The robot should unstack B from C to free up block C. This action will allow us to reconfigure the blocks correctly in subsequent moves.

Action: unstack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block B, and the goal requires block C to be on top of B. To achieve this, block B needs to be positioned so that block C can be placed on top of it in future moves.

Think: Since the goal is to have block C on top of block B, and all the blocks including C are clear and on the table, the best action now is to put down block B on the table. This will keep B clear and ready for block C to be stacked upon it afterwards.

Action: put-down(b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, all of which are currently placed on a table. Each of these blocks (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning that there is no other block on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and all blocks are clear and on the table, providing a good starting point to rearrange the blocks according to the goal state. The goal requires stacking block C on block B and then stacking block D on block C.

Think: The next logical step to achieve the goal is to start by picking up block C, as the goal state requires block C to be on top of block B. Once block C is in the robot's hand, it can be stacked on block B in a subsequent move.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, blocks a, b, and d are on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block c is being held by the robot hand. This setup allows for actions such as moving block c to the table or on top of any of the clear blocks a, b, or d. Additionally, because blocks a, b, and d are clear, they can have other blocks stacked on them.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is holding block C, and the immediate goal is to arrange C on top of B, followed by placing D on top of C. This configuration requires careful planning around the stacking order of these blocks.

Think: Since block C needs to be on top of block B according to the goal, and block B is clear and available on the table, the correct action now is to stack block C directly onto block B. This aligns perfectly with the goal configuration, setting up the next steps to place block D on top of block C.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is interacting with the environment in the following ways:

- Blocks A, B, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block B.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of these blocks.
- The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.

This setup provides a clear view of the starting configuration where the robot can interact with blocks A, C, and D directly due to their clear status, and can manipulate Block B by first moving Block C.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has block C correctly stacked on top of block B, aligning with part of the goal state. The robot hand is empty, and the next step should focus on placing block D on top of block C, as required by the goal.

Think: To achieve the goal state, block D needs to be picked up and then stacked on top of block C. Since block D is clear and on the table, and the actions available include picking up block D, this is the appropriate next step to progress towards the goal.

Action: pick-up(d:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment setup, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block b is also on the table.
- Block c is not on the table; instead, it is placed on top of block b and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.

This setup of blocks and their conditions define how the robot can interact with them using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state shows that block C is already on top of block B, which partially fulfills the goal state. The robot hand is holding block D, which is the final block that needs to be positioned according to the goal state, specifically on top of block C.

Think: To complete the arrangement as per the goal state, block D should be stacked on top of block C. This action will finalize the configuration by positioning all blocks in the correct order, achieving the goal.
