ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, the robot's hand is empty. Block 'b' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block 'c' is directly on the table. Block 'b' is placed on top of block 'a', and block 'a' is on top of block 'c', forming a stack with 'c' at the base, 'a' in the middle, and 'b' at the top.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment includes a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. Additionally, the robot's hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block B.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In this environment, understanding the structure and placement of blocks is critical for choosing the correct actions. The valid actions provided are specific to the configuration of the blocks and the robot's current state.

Think: Since the goal is to have block 'A' on top of block 'B', the current configuration needs to be altered. Block 'B' is currently on top of block 'A', which means I need to change their order. The valid action available is 'unstack(b:default,a:default)', which will remove block 'B' from atop block 'A' and hold it in the robot's hand. This action prepares for a subsequent repositioning of the blocks to achieve the goal state.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, there are three blocks named a, b, and c. Block a is positioned on top of block c and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block c is placed directly on the table. Meanwhile, the robot hand is currently holding block b.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment includes a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. Additionally, the robot's hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block B.
