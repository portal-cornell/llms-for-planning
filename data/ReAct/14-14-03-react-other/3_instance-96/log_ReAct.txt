ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld scenario, there are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. Block b is positioned on top of block a, and block c is sitting on the table. Both blocks a and c are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, block c is on the table, ensuring it's resting directly on the table surface. This setup of blocks and the state of the robot's hand describe the initial environment configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block 'b' positioned on top of block 'c'.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: No error feedback was provided in this turn, so the previous actions or understanding of the environment is assumed correct. 

Think: The goal is to have block 'b' positioned on top of block 'c'. Currently, block 'b' is on top of block 'a', and block 'c' is clear on the table. The robot hand is empty. The first logical step is to free up block 'b' by removing it from block 'a'. The only action that makes sense to begin with, given the valid actions, is to unstack block 'b' from block 'a'.

Action: unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, blocks A and C are positioned on the table and have no other blocks on top of them, which makes them clear. The robot hand is holding block B. This setup indicates that block B is neither on the table nor clear since it is being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block 'b' positioned on top of block 'c'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action of unstacking block 'b' from block 'a' was successful, and now the robot hand is holding block 'b'. This aligns with the correct strategy to achieve the goal state.

Think: The goal is to stack block 'b' on top of block 'c'. Currently, block 'b' is in the robot's hand, and block 'c' is clear on the table. The valid actions available allow for stacking block 'b' directly on block 'c', which exactly aligns with the goal state requirements.

Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
