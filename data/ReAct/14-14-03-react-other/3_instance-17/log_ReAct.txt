ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment:

- There are three blocks named 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
- All three blocks ('a', 'b', and 'c') are placed directly on the table.
- Each of these blocks ('a', 'b', and 'c') is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any of the blocks.

This setup represents a starting or intermediate state where the blocks are separated and accessible, and the robot hand is ready to perform actions such as picking up any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves all blocks being clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty. The goal is to have a specific arrangement of blocks, with 'c' on 'a' and 'a' on 'b'. Given the valid actions, the robot can only pick up blocks at this point.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the first logical step is to arrange 'a' on 'b'. To do this, I must first pick up 'b', as it will serve as the base. However, since picking up 'b' directly isn't listed as a subsequent action after any other moves, I will start by picking up 'a', preparing to eventually place it on 'b'.

Action: pick-up(a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three objects identified as blocks a, b, and c. The block b is located on the table and there's nothing on top of it, making it clear. Similarly, block c is also on the table and clear. The robot hand is currently holding block a.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: With the robot hand currently holding block 'a', the available actions are to put it down or stack it on either 'b' or 'c'. The goal is specifically to stack 'a' on 'b', which aligns perfectly with one of the valid actions.

Think: Since the goal includes having 'a' on 'b', and this action is directly available, it's the most straightforward next step. Stacking 'a' on 'b' will progress us towards the goal configuration, and from there, only 'c' will need to be placed on top of 'a' to complete the arrangement.

Action: stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, block A is on top of block B, and both block B and block C are on the table. Block C and block A are clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current setup has 'a' already stacked on 'b', which is part of the goal state. The remaining task is to get 'c' on top of 'a'. The robot's hand is empty, and the valid actions are either to pick up 'c' or to unstack 'a' from 'b'. Since unstacking 'a' from 'b' would be counterproductive, the focus should be on manipulating 'c'.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, 'c' needs to be on top of 'a'. Since 'c' is clear and the robot hand is empty, the best move is to pick up 'c', preparing it to be stacked on 'a' in a future action. This action aligns with moving towards the goal without undoing any previous progress.

Action: pick-up(c:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three objects identified as block A, block B, and block C. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows: Block B is on the table, Block A is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it, and the robot hand is holding Block C. Additionally, Block A is positioned on top of Block B. This setup indicates that Block A and Block B are stacked together, while Block C is in the robot's hand, and Block B is directly on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block 'c', and the configuration of 'a' on 'b' is already achieved. The goal is to have 'c' on top of 'a'. The available actions directly support this goal.

Think: Given that 'a' is clear and the correct base for 'c' according to the goal state, the most effective and direct action to take is to stack 'c' on 'a'. This action will complete the arrangement as specified in the goal state.

Action: stack(c:default,a:default)
