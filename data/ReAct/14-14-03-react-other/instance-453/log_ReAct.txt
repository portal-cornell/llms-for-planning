ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within a Blocksworld domain involving a robot and several blocks labeled a, b, c, d, and e:

1. The robot's hand is empty.
2. Block c is placed directly on the table.
3. Block d is supporting block a.
4. Block e is situated on top of block a.
5. Block b is stacked on block c.
6. The block e is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.

Each block is involved in a relationship either with the table or another block, defining the structure and current state of the block setup.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'e', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired state.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The environment involves manipulating blocks with a robot arm, where only specific actions are valid based on the current configuration of blocks. The valid actions depend on the physical arrangement of blocks, such as whether they are clear and not supporting another block.

Think: Since the only valid action available is to unstack block 'e' from block 'a', and block 'e' is clear (no other blocks on top of it), this is a feasible move. Unstacking 'e' from 'a' will not only adhere to the current valid actions but also make block 'a' available for further repositioning, which might be necessary to achieve the goal state.

Action: unstack(e:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, the robot hand is currently holding block E. Blocks are arranged in a specific order: Block A is on top of Block D, Block D is on top of Block B, and Block B is on top of Block C. Block C is directly on the table. Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The objects in this scenario include five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'e', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, which means actions involving block E must be considered to make it available for further manipulation toward the goal state. The goal is to have block B on top of block E and block D on top of block B. Therefore, block E needs to be clear and placed in a position where block B can be stacked on top of it.

Think: Since block E is currently in the robot's hand, the immediate options are to either put it down on the table or stack it on another block. However, stacking it back on block A does not help progress towards the goal state. Putting block E down will free up the robot's hand and make block E available as a base for block B, aligning with the goal state requirement.

Action: put-down(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block C is placed on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block C.
- Block D is also on the table, with Block A stacked on top of it.
- Block E is clear and placed directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves various blocks either being stacked on one another or resting clear on the table, ready for manipulation by the robot's actions.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'e', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and the goal is to reposition block B on top of block E, and subsequently, block D on top of block B. Therefore, manipulating blocks B, D, and E are critical to achieving this configuration. Block E, being clear and on the table, is a potential base for block B.

Think: Block E needs to be utilized as a base for block B to progress towards the goal. Given the valid actions, the robot can either pick up block E or unstack block A from block D. Picking up block E is a strategic move as it prepares to directly stack it underneath block B in subsequent steps, aligning with the goal state requirements.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, the robot hand is currently holding block E. Blocks are arranged in a specific order: Block A is on top of Block D, Block D is on top of Block B, and Block B is on top of Block C. Block C is directly on the table. Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The objects in this scenario include five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'e', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal involves stacking block B on top of block E, and then stacking block D on top of block B. To facilitate this arrangement, block E needs to be placed strategically to eventually support block B.

Think: The action to stack block E on block A is available but does not contribute to reaching the goal. Placing block E on the table (putting it down) is a necessary step to use it later as a base for block B, aligning with the desired final configuration.

Action: put-down(e:default)

The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'e', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the goal is to stack block B on top of block E, then block D on top of block B. Manipulating blocks B, D, and E in a sequence that aligns with the goal is crucial.

Think: To achieve the goal, block E needs to be the base for block B. Since block E is clear and on the table, picking it up will allow us to subsequently stack block B on top of it, moving closer to the goal configuration.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal is to stack block B on top of E, followed by stacking D on top of B. It's essential for block E to be in a position where it can serve as the base for block B.

Think: Since block E needs to be the base for block B, and block B is currently on top of block C, stacking E on A would not contribute to achieving the goal. The best move is to put down block E on the table, making it available as a base for block B, which aligns with the goal state.

The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'e', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired state.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is empty, and the target configuration requires block B to be stacked on block E, with block D subsequently stacked on block B. Block E is currently clear and on the table, making it accessible for manipulation.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, block E needs to be the base for block B. Picking up block E will allow for subsequent actions to stack block B on it, moving closer to achieving the desired structure.

- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is currently holding block E, and the goal is to have block B on top of block E, followed by block D on top of block B. It's crucial to position block E in a way that aligns with the goal configuration.

Think: Given the goal, block E should be placed on the table to potentially serve as a base for block B. Stacking E on A does not help achieve the goal configuration. Therefore, the correct action is to put block E down on the table, making it available to subsequently stack block B on top of it.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and based on the goal, it is essential to manipulate blocks B, E, and D. The immediate need is to position block E to eventually support block B.

Think: Block E is currently clear and on the table, making it a suitable candidate for the base of block B. By picking up block E, the robot can then be positioned to stack block B on top of E in the next move, aligning with the goal state configuration.

Action: pick-up(e:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, the robot hand is currently holding block E. Blocks are arranged in a specific order: Block A is on top of Block D, Block D is on top of Block B, and Block B is on top of Block C. Block C is directly on the table. Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The objects in this scenario include five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'e', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired state.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(e:default)
- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot is presently holding block E, and the goal state requires block E to serve as a base for block B, followed by stacking block D on top of block B. Thus, block E needs to be positioned on the table to facilitate these stacking actions.

Think: Given the goal and the current state, the best move is to put block E down on the table. This action will make block E available to later stack block B on top of it. Stacking block E on block A does not align with the goal, hence, putting block E down is the strategic action to progress towards the desired configuration.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot's hand is empty, and the goal is to configure the blocks so that block B is on top of block E, and block D is on top of block B. The current valid actions suggest possibilities for either handling block E or manipulating the stack of blocks A and D.

Think: Since block E needs to be underneath block B according to the goal state, the first step towards this configuration is to handle block E, which is currently clear on the table. Picking up block E will prepare us to eventually place block B on top of it in subsequent moves.

- stack(e:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Holding block E in the robot's hand, the goal demands placing block B on top of E, and then D on top of B. For this configuration, block E needs to be positioned suitably to serve as a base for block B.

Think: Placing block E back on block A is not conducive to achieving the goal state. Instead, putting block E down on the table will prepare it to support block B, aligning with the goal state requirements. This action will set the stage for stacking block B on E in future moves.
