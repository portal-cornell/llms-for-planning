ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c. Block b is currently on the table, and the robot's hand is empty. Both block b and block c are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Block c is on top of block a, which is also on the table. This configuration allows for various manipulations by the robot to rearrange the blocks according to certain goals, using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is for block C to be positioned on top of block B. This setup involves multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that manipulates the blocks. The blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or remain empty. The objective is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the specified configuration where block C is directly on block B.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves block c being on top of block a, and both block b and block c are clear. The goal is to have block c on block b. Hence, to achieve this, block c needs to be moved from block a to block b. 

Think: Since block c is currently on top of block a, the first logical step is to free block c from block a. The valid action to do this is to unstack block c from block a. This action will place block c in the robot's hand, making it available to be stacked on block b in a subsequent move.

Action: unstack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PROPOSAL PROMPT

Current State:
In the environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, blocks 'a' and 'b' are positioned on the table and are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is holding block 'c'.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is for block C to be positioned on top of block B. This setup involves multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that manipulates the blocks. The blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or remain empty. The objective is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the specified configuration where block C is directly on block B.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


ACTION PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The robot hand is currently holding block c, and both blocks a and b are clear on the table. The goal is for block c to be on top of block b.

Think: Given that block c is in the robot's hand and the goal is to have block c stacked on block b, the direct action needed is to stack block c on block b. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state, as it places block c directly where it needs to be according to the goal.

Action: stack(c:default,b:default)
