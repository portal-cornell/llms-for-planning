ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, the robot hand is holding block C. Both blocks A and B are placed on the table and are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This setup allows for actions like moving block C to the table or stacking it on either block A or B, if necessary.
Goal State:
In the blocks world environment with a robot hand, there are several blocks and a table. The robot can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, putting them down, and stacking them on each other or on the table. The ultimate goal in this specific scenario is to have block 'a' stacked on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state describes block C being held by the robot hand, with blocks A and B clear on the table. The goal state requires block A to be stacked on block C. To achieve this, the robot has to put down block C (either directly on the table or on block B), then pick up block A, and finally stack A on C. The current configuration facilitates these moves as it allows the robot to manipulate block C and subsequently block A to achieve the desired arrangement.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three objects identified as a, b, and c. These objects interact in various ways according to the predicates given:

1. **on(c, b)**: Object c is positioned on top of object b.
2. **clear(c)**: There is nothing on top of object c, making it clear and accessible.
3. **holding(a)**: The robot hand is currently holding object a.
4. **ontable(b)**: Object b is directly on the table, indicating it is not being held or supported by another object.

This setup forms part of a scenario in the Blocksworld domain where blocks can be moved and stacked, and the robot can manipulate these blocks. The current state suggests that the robot is holding block a, block c is clear and is placed on top of block b, which itself is on the table.
Goal State:
In the blocks world environment with a robot hand, there are several blocks and a table. The robot can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, putting them down, and stacking them on each other or on the table. The ultimate goal in this specific scenario is to have block 'a' stacked on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block 'c' is on top of block 'b' and block 'a' is being held by the robot. The goal is for block 'a' to be stacked on block 'c'. Since block 'c' is clear, the robot can directly perform the action of stacking block 'a' on block 'c'. This suggests that the current state is conducive to reaching the goal state with just one action.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, with the following arrangement: Block A is directly on top of Block C, and Block C is on top of Block B. Block B is placed directly on the table. Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty.
Goal State:
In the blocks world environment with a robot hand, there are several blocks and a table. The robot can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, putting them down, and stacking them on each other or on the table. The ultimate goal in this specific scenario is to have block 'a' stacked on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block A is already on top of Block C, which is a part of the goal state configuration. However, Block C is not directly on the table, as it is on top of Block B. To achieve the goal state, a possible sequence of actions would be to unstack Block A from Block C, put down Block A, unstack Block C from Block B, and then restack Block A on Block C. Since Block A is already clear and the robot's hand is empty, these actions can be efficiently executed to reach the goal state configuration.
