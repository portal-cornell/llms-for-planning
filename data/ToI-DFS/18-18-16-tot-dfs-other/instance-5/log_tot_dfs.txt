ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Here's the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block A is also on the table.
3. Block B is on top of Block A.
4. The robot hand is holding Block C.
5. Blocks B and D are clear, which means nothing is on top of them.

This setup captures the positions and status of the blocks and the robot hand's activity.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on another or unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows Block B already on top of Block A, which is a crucial part of the goal state. The robot hand is holding Block C, which needs to have Block D placed on top of it according to the goal state. Since Block D is clear and on the table, the next steps can involve putting Block C down on the table and then stacking Block D on Block C. This makes the transition toward the goal state straightforward with just a few moves needed.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four objects identified as a, b, c, and d. The current state includes:
- Block c is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
- Block c is on top of block b.
- The robot hand is holding block d.
- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on top of block a.

This setup involves blocks a, b, and c arranged in a stack, with block b on top of a and block c on top of b, while block d is being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on another or unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows a configuration where block c is on top of block b, which is on top of block a, and the robot hand is holding block d. The goal state requires block b on top of block a (which is already achieved) and block d on top of block c. The robot holding block d means it can directly execute the action to stack block d on block c. Since part of the goal configuration (b on a) is already met and the robot is in position to complete the other part by stacking d on c, this state is likely on the path to the goal state.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocks World environment, we have four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block d is on top of block c.
- Block c is on top of block b.
- Block b is directly on top of block a.
- Block a is positioned on the table.
- Block d is the only block that is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup describes the current state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the current goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup involves manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can perform actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on another or unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current configuration has block d on top of c, c on b, and b on a, with all blocks in a single stack. The goal is to have b on a and d on c, with these two pairs potentially in separate stacks. From the current state, achieving the goal would require unstacking blocks to rearrange them according to the goal state. The robot hand being empty is beneficial as it can immediately start to pick up and rearrange blocks without needing to put down a block first. The steps might involve unstacking d from c, then b from a, followed by re-stacking them according to the goal state. The configuration is already partially correct (d on c), simplifying the required actions.
