ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
- pick-up(a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. Block d is positioned on top of block c, and block c is on top of block b. Block b is placed directly on the table. Block d is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it. The robot's hand is currently holding block a.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, blocks B, C, and D are already arranged sequentially from bottom to top as B-C-D, and the robot hand is holding block A. The goal state requires block C to be on top of B (which is already achieved) and block D to be on top of A. Since the robot hand is holding block A, it can directly stack block D on block A after placing A down on the table. This suggests that the current state is quite close to the goal state, with only a few moves required to achieve the goal configuration.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup of these blocks is as follows:

- Block C is on top of block B, and block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block A is clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block B is also directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block D.

This configuration sets the stage for potential actions such as moving block D or rearranging blocks A, B, and C.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block C is already on top of block B, which aligns with part of the goal state. Block A is on the table and clear, just as needed to place block D on top of it. The robot hand is holding block D, making it immediately possible to place D on A to achieve the goal configuration. Therefore, the current state is effectively set up for direct actions to reach the goal.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup of these blocks is as follows:

- Block C is on top of block B, and block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block A is clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block B is also directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block D.

This configuration sets the stage for potential actions such as moving block D or rearranging blocks A, B, and C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Currently, the robot's hand is holding block D, and the goal is to have block D stacked on block A. The valid actions allow for stacking D directly onto A, which aligns perfectly with achieving part of the goal state. The second action should address the arrangement of blocks B and C, which are already in the desired configuration according to the goal state. Therefore, no further action is necessary for B and C.

Actions: stack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The distribution of blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block B and is clear.
- Block D is on the table and it is clear.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup indicates that the blocks are partially stacked with A, B, and D directly on the table and C on top of B. The robot's hand being empty suggests readiness to perform any of the block manipulation actions like picking up or stacking.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has several elements already aligned with the goal state. Block C is on top of Block B, which is exactly where it needs to be according to the goal state. Block D and Block A are both clear and on the table. The goal requires Block D to be on top of Block A. Since the robot hand is empty, the robot can directly pick up Block D and stack it on Block A. Since there is no need to rearrange Blocks B and C, and the next actions to align D on A are straightforward, the current state appears to be very close to the goal state.
Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned such that:
- Block D is on top of Block A and Block D is clear.
- Block C is on top of Block B and Block C is clear.
- Both Blocks A and B are on the table.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup allows for operations involving moving the clear blocks (C and D) or manipulating the situation of Blocks A and B while adhering to the constraints that the hand is empty and certain blocks are resting on the table.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state aligns directly with the goal state described. Block C is already on top of Block B and Block D is on top of Block A, as required by the goal state. Furthermore, both blocks C and D are clear, and the robotâ€™s hand is empty, which does not conflict with any goal condition. Therefore, no further actions are needed to rearrange the blocks to meet the goal state conditions.
