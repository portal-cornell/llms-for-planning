VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block d is on top of block a and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block c is being held by the robot hand. Both blocks a and b are on the table, with block b also being clear. This setup indicates that the robot can manipulate these blocks, typically moving them to achieve a specified configuration.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block c in the robot's hand and block d on top of block a, while blocks a and b are on the table. To achieve the goal state where block a is on top of block b, the robot needs to manipulate these blocks accordingly. Since block c is already in hand, the robot can put it down on the table or on another block to free up the hand. Then, the robot can unstack block d from a, put down block d, and finally stack block a on block b. The current configuration does not prevent these steps from being executed, suggesting that it is on the path to the goal state.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In this scenario, the goal is to have Block A on top of Block B. Currently, Block A is clear and on the table, and Block B is also on the table and clear, which is a promising setup for achieving the goal. The robot hand is holding Block D, which is not directly involved in achieving the goal configuration of A on B. The next steps could involve putting down Block D and then using the robot hand to stack Block A on Block B. The current setup does not present any obstacles that prevent moving towards the goal, such as blocks that would need to be moved out of the way to clear a path for A or B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot is holding Block D and needs to free its hand to manipulate other blocks to achieve the goal of stacking Block A on Block B. Since Block A is already clear, the robot just needs to be able to access Block B which is currently on the table and not obstructed. However, to reach the goal, Block D needs to be placed down first. The valid actions suggest that Block D can be either put down on the table or stacked on another block, but stacking it on Block C or A does not directly contribute to achieving the goal. The best approach is to put Block D down to free the robot's hand and then pick up Block A for stacking.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the current state where the robot hand is holding Block D, and the goal is to have Block A on top of Block B, the first action should involve placing Block D in a position that doesn't obstruct the necessary movement of Block A or Block B. The valid actions allow for putting down Block D or stacking it on Block A or Block C. Since placing Block D on Block A might complicate the access to Block A, the better options are to put down Block D or stack it on Block C. After placing Block D, the next action should focus on starting the configuration of Block A onto Block B. Since Block A is already clear and on the table, picking up Block A (once the hand is free) would be the next logical step to progress towards the goal.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal of stacking block A on top of block B, it is important to consider the current state where block A and block B are both on the table and clear. Since the robot hand is currently holding block D, the first action should involve dealing with block D. The valid action 'put-down(d:default)' will place block D onto the table, freeing up the robot hand. This is necessary because the robot hand needs to be empty to pick up block A. Once the hand is empty, the next step would be to prepare for stacking block A onto block B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D, and blocks A and B are clear on the table. To progress toward the goal, block D needs to be managed first. The most straightforward action would be to put down block D to free the robot hand. This would allow subsequent manipulation of block A or B, which are key to achieving the goal state. The next optimal move would be to unstack or pick up block A since it needs to be positioned on block B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have Block A stacked on Block B. Currently, Block C is on top of Block B, making Block B not clear and unable to have another block placed on it. The robot hand is holding Block D, and the valid actions include putting down D or stacking D on top of A or C. The first step should involve clearing the hand by placing Block D down since stacking it on C won't help progress towards the goal, and stacking it on A does not help in arranging A on B. After freeing the hand, the next step should be preparing to move Block C from Block B to potentially clear Block B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To approach the goal state where block A is on top of block B, we need to first ensure that block A is clear and can be manipulated. Given that block C is currently held by the robot hand and block B is clear, we can stack block C on block B. This will keep block B in place, clear, and ready for block A to be stacked upon it later. After stacking block C on B, the next sensible step is to free up the robot hand by picking up block A, preparing it to be stacked on block B in subsequent moves.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal where block A is on top of block B, and considering block A is currently beneath block D on the table, the robot needs to free block A. Since block C is currently held by the robot hand, the robot should either put down block C or stack it on another block to free the robot hand so that later actions can manipulate block A. The valid action to put down C or to stack C on block D won't immediately achieve the goal but will set the stage for future moves. Stacking C on block B would be more beneficial as it keeps block B clear, which is necessary for placing block A on it later.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block D is on top of block A, which complicates the immediate placement of block A on top of block B. To achieve the goal state, block D must first be moved from block A. Since the robot hand is empty and block D is clear, the robot can pick up block D and place it elsewhere (either on the table or on another block that is clear). Once block D is moved, block A will be clear and can be directly placed on block B. This sequence of actions is logically consistent with typical operations in the Blocksworld environment and is feasible based on the current configuration.

In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block d is on top of block a and block d is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block c is on top of block b and block c is also clear. Blocks a and b are directly on the table.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state of the blocks is that block d is on top of block a, and block c is on top of block b. The goal is to have block a on top of block b. Given that block a already has block d on it, block d needs to be moved before block a can be placed on block b. Similarly, block c needs to be moved before block b is accessible to have block a placed on it. The robot hand is currently empty, which is beneficial as it can start by picking up block d from block a or block c from block b. The actions needed involve removing the top blocks (unstack actions), followed by stacking block a on block b after they are both cleared.

Rating: maybe

The current state isn't directly on the path to the goal, but the actions required to reach the goal from the current state are straightforward and involve typical Blocksworld operations. Therefore, it is possible that the current configuration is on a path toward the goal, assuming correct and efficient actions are executed by manipulating the blocks using the robot hand.

Think: To advance towards the goal state where block A is on top of block B, block D must first be moved away from block A.

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding Block B, which means the next action can either be to put Block B down on the table or on another block. Since the goal is to have Block A on top of Block B, placing Block B directly on the table would be a strategic move. This would allow the robot to then manipulate Block A (which is already on the table and clear from the current state description) to be placed on top of Block B in a subsequent action. Block C being clear and on the table is not directly relevant to achieving the goal, nor is the position of Block D on top of Block A, as these do not interfere with placing A on B. Thus, the current state is conducive as a starting point to reach the goal state by potentially putting Block B down and then stacking Block A on it.

Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block A on top of block B, block A needs to be clear and on top of block B. Currently, block A is clear and on the table, and block B is also clear. The robot is holding block D. To move towards the goal, the robot can first put down block D and then pick up block A to be ready to stack it on block B in future actions.

In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s the configuration of the blocks and the robot hand:

- Blocks A, B, and C are on the table.
- All blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently holding block D. 

This setup is part of a system where the robot can interact with these blocks, typically to reconfigure them by stacking or unstacking, and the goal is to achieve a specific arrangement of these blocks.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is stacked on block B, we first need to ensure that block B is clear and ready to receive block A on top. Since the robot hand is currently holding block D, and block B is clear, the immediate action that seems most beneficial is to stack block D on a different block to keep block B clear. Following that, block A, which is currently clear and on the table, can be targeted for the next move. Therefore, the first action should involve placing D on any block other than B to keep B clear for the next step. A possible second action would be to prepare or directly stack A on B, but since the robot's hand will be empty, we will need to pick up A first.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is stacked on top of block B, the primary requirement is that block B must be clear and block A must be positioned correctly to be moved on top of B. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D, and block B is clear. A sensible first action would be to put down block D, ensuring it doesn't interfere with the arrangement of blocks A and B. Once block D is placed on the table and the robot hand is free, the next action can focus on manipulating block A to achieve the goal configuration.

Think: To reach the goal where block A is on top of block B, block B must be clear, and block A must be picked up and stacked on B. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D. The first action should involve placing D so the robot hand becomes free to manipulate other blocks. The valid actions include stacking D on another block or putting it down on the table. Stacking D on another block may lead to further complications as we need block A to be clear to stack it on B. Therefore, the simplest action is to put down D on the table. After putting down D, my next action should focus on preparing to stack A on B. Since B is already clear, the robot hand needs to pick up A, which requires that the hand is empty (achieved after putting down D).

Think: To approach the goal of having Block A on top of Block B, Block B needs to be clear and on the table, or on the table with A directly on it. Currently, the robot hand is holding Block B. The valid actions suggest that we can either stack Block B on Block C or D, or put it down on the table. Since the goal involves Block A being on top of Block B, and Block A is already on the table, it's essential to free up Block B by putting it down. This will prepare us for the next step where we can manipulate Block A to be on top of Block B.

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block A is on top of block B, it is important to clear the way for block A to be manipulated. Currently, the robot's hand is holding block B, so it needs to be placed down to eventually manipulate block A. The valid actions include stacking block B on blocks C or D, or putting it down on the table. Placing block B directly on the table clears other blocks and keeps more options open for subsequent moves, as stacking B on C or D might later necessitate additional moves to clear these blocks again.

Think: The goal is to have Block A on top of Block B. Currently, Block B is held by the robot and Block A is on the table. To progress towards the goal, Block B must first be placed on the table or on another block to make it available for Block A to be stacked upon it later. The valid actions include stacking Block B on either Block C or Block D, or putting Block B down on the table. Since stacking Block B on either Block C or D does not directly help achieve the goal configuration, the best move is to put Block B down on the table, making it clear.

Think: To move towards the goal state where Block A is on top of Block B, we need both Blocks A and B to be in positions where they can be manipulated to achieve this configuration. Currently, Block B is in the robot's hand, and Block A is on the table but not clear due to Block D on top of it. The first step should be to put Block B down on the table or stack it on another block to free the robot's hand. The valid action to put Block B down seems most straightforward as it does not depend on the position of other blocks. Once Block B is on the table and clear, the robot's hand will be free to manipulate other blocks, such as removing Block D from Block A.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, we need to first ensure that block B is clear and placed in a position where block A can be stacked on it. Since the robot hand is currently holding block B, the next steps should involve placing block B in a clear position. The valid actions allow either stacking block B on block C or D, or putting it down on the table.

Given that block A is already on the table and the goal is to stack it on block B, the most straightforward approach would be to put down block B on the table, making it clear and ready to have block A stacked on it in the future. Therefore, the first action should be to put down block B. Once block B is on the table and clear, the subsequent action in the next turn can involve manipulating block A to stack it on block B.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, the current state provides a clear starting point. Since block B is already clear, it can be used as a base. However, block A is currently underneath block D, so block D needs to be moved first. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it can immediately begin operations like unstacking block D from block A. Once block D is moved, block A will be clear and can be stacked on block B.

Block D is underneath block C and on top of block A, creating a circular stacking which is impossible in real-world physics and indicates a misinterpretation or error in the current state description. Assuming this was a typo or error, and interpreting it as each block being stacked linearly (e.g., D on A, B on C), the pathway to the goal would involve unstacking and restacking blocks. The clarity of block B is beneficial as it allows block A to be directly placed on it once block D and C are managed. However, the described circular stacking needs to be resolved to proceed accurately.

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In this scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D within a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it, and it is located on the table.
- Block D is also clear and is positioned on top of Block A.
- Block A is on the table.
- The robot hand is holding Block B.

This setup involves Blocks A, B, C, and D, with specific positions and conditions that relate to how they can be manipulated by the robot.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding Block B, which is a crucial step towards achieving the goal state where Block A must be on top of Block B. However, before Block A can be placed on Block B, Block B needs to be put down either on the table or directly under Block A. Since Block A is already on the table, the most straightforward action would be to put down Block B on the table, clear Block D from the top of Block A (if required by the action rules, but since Block A needs to be on top of Block B, it might not be necessary to move D first), and then stack Block A on Block B.

Considering that the robot is already holding Block B, the sequence of actions to reach the goal state is shorter, making it more likely that the current state is on the path to the goal state. The important factor here is the robot's current action capability (holding B), which directly supports the next steps in the plan toward the goal.

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration and status of each:

- Block C is on the table.
- Block A is also on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block D is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block B is on top of Block C and is clear.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to each other, the table, and the robot's hand.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has Block D in the robot's hand and Block B on top of Block C with Block A clear on the table. To achieve the goal state where Block A is on top of Block B, the robot will need to put down Block D, unstack Block B from Block C, and then stack Block A on Block B. The presence of a clear Block A and the fact that Block B is already clear and only needs to be unstacked from C, makes the goal achievable through a series of logical steps. Therefore, the current state seems to be on the path towards the goal, given that the robot can perform these actions consecutively.

The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, we need to first ensure both blocks A and B are in positions where they can be manipulated to achieve the desired configuration. Currently, block D is held by the robot and block B is not clear as it is on top of block C, making it impossible to stack A directly on B. The first action should be aimed at freeing up block B by placing block D somewhere. The valid actions include stacking D on B or A, or putting D down. Stacking D on A or B does not directly help in achieving the goal state and would complicate the configuration even more. The best move now is to put down block D to clear the robot's hand and make it available for subsequent moves. The next action should then focus on making block B clear by moving block A on top of it, but since A is on the table, we first need to pick it up with the robot's hand.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block A on block B, I need to ensure that both A and B are in positions where they can be interacted with directly. Block D is currently held by the robot's hand. The first action should involve placing D, to free the robot's hand for subsequent moves. The valid actions suggest placing D on A or B. Placing D on B would block access to B, which is counterproductive towards the goal. Therefore, placing D on A is a preferable initial step. After placing D on A, the robot's hand will be free, allowing a subsequent action to manipulate block A or B as needed.

2. Block C is also on the table.
3. Block D is on the table and it is clear.
4. Block B is on top of Block C and it is clear.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state of having Block A on top of Block B, several steps need to be taken from the current configuration. Block B is currently not clear as it is on top of Block C, so initially, Block B needs to be made clear. This can be done by unstacking Block B from Block C and putting it down on the table or stacking it on another clear block like Block D. Next, Block A needs to be picked up and stacked on Block B. Since the robot's hand is empty, it is already in a good position to start these operations. The current state allows for these operations as necessary blocks are clear and accessible, and the robot hand is empty.

Think: The current state indicates a clear path towards the goal state. The goal is to have Block A on top of Block B. In the current configuration, Block B is clear and on top of Block C, which means it can be directly accessed to place another block on top of it. Block A is also accessible since it's on the table under Block D. The sequence of actions to reach the goal would involve unstacking Block D from Block A, and then stacking Block A on Block B. Both blocks required for the goal are already clear or can be made clear with minimal moves, making this a straightforward path to the goal.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal of having block A on top of block B, I first need to ensure that block B is clear and accessible. Given that block B is currently on top of block C, using the 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' action will make block B available for further manipulation by putting it in the robot's hand. Once block B is in the hand, the robot will be able to stack it later as needed. The next action should involve picking up block A, as it is clear and on the table, preparing it for stacking on block B in a subsequent step.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has block a in the robot's hand, which is good because it needs to be placed on block b to meet the goal state. Block b is clear and on top of block c, allowing the robot to directly stack block a onto block b without needing to manipulate block b first.

Since I can propose two actions right now and given the valid actions available, the first step should be to pick up block A.

Actions: pick-up(a:default), pick-up(b:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment configuration of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The blocks are arranged as follows:

1. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is being held by the robot hand.
3. Blocks A, C, and D are clear, which means there are no other blocks on top of them. 

This setup indicates an initial state where the robot hand is occupied and three blocks are ready to be manipulated or built upon, as they are clear and accessible.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block B is already being held by the robot hand, which is a necessary step before stacking it. Since Block A is clear and on the table, the robot can easily place Block B on the table and then stack Block A on top of Block B. This sequence of actions is straightforward and aligns with the goal state requirements. Therefore, the current state seems to be a promising start towards achieving the goal configuration.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here’s the summary of their configuration and status:

- Block d is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block c is also on the table and clear, with no blocks on top of it.
- Block b is positioned on the table and is clear as well.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block a. 

This setup indicates that all blocks except for block a are on the table and are not stacked on one another. The robot hand is occupied with block a, which is not placed on the table or any other block.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, the robot's next logical actions would be to put down block A and then stack it on block B. The current state with the robot holding block A and block B being clear on the table sets the stage for these actions to be carried out directly. There are no unnecessary or conflicting block placements that would prevent or complicate reaching the goal state in a straightforward manner. Therefore, the current state is conducive to moving towards the goal state efficiently.

Rating: sure

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here’s the summary of their configuration and status:

- Block d is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block c is also on the table and clear, with no blocks on top of it.
- Block b is positioned on the table and is clear as well.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block a. 

This setup indicates that all blocks except for block a are on the table and are not stacked on one another. The robot hand is occupied with block a, which is not placed on the table or any other block.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)

In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Since the goal is to have block A on top of block B, and currently the robot's hand is holding block A, the direct action to achieve this without unnecessary moves is to stack block A on block B. The action "stack(a:default,b:default)" is available and directly aligns with the goal state requirements. Since two actions are required, an additional valid action can be chosen that does not interfere with this goal state. The only other action that wouldn't disturb the target configuration is "put-down(a:default)", but performing it would necessitate another pick-up action later, which is not efficient here. Instead, considering future potential configurations, the second action can be a neutral action not affecting the goal but preparing for possible subsequent needs, such as "stack(a:default,c:default)" which can be used to demonstrate an alternative stacking if needed.

Actions: stack(a:default,b:default), stack(a:default,c:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, alongside a table and a robot hand. Currently, block D and block C are placed on the table, and the robot's hand is empty. Block A is stacked on top of block C and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block B is also on the table and is clear. Block D is clear as well.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block A is placed on block C, while block B is clear on the table. The goal is to have block A stacked on block B. To achieve the goal, the robot will need to perform a series of actions: First, it could unstack block A from block C and then either place it on the table or directly stack it on block B. Given that block B is clear and on the table, and block A is already clear, the path toward the goal seems straightforward with a feasible sequence of actions. The current state has all blocks in accessible positions, which facilitates reaching the goal.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D and a table. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D and Block C are both on the table and are clear.
2. Block A is on top of Block B and is also clear.
3. Block B is on the table.
4. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates that the blocks are partially stacked with A on B, while the rest are positioned separately on the table, and nothing is currently being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block A on top of block B. The setup includes a series of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. Blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table, and only blocks with nothing on them are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The objective is to move blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block A is directly on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state already meets the goal state requirements as Block A is on top of Block B, which is the desired arrangement according to the goal state description. The robot hand being empty does not affect the completion of the goal, as it does not need to hold any block to maintain the current configuration. The positions of Blocks C and D, both being clear and on the table, do not interfere with the goal state arrangement of Blocks A and B.
