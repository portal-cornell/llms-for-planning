ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
- pick-up(a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand is as follows:

1. Block 'c' is on the table.
2. Block 'd' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
3. Block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.
4. The robot hand is holding block 'a'.
5. Block 'd' is stacked on top of block 'b'.

This setup implies that blocks 'b' and 'd' form a stack, with 'b' at the base and 'd' on top, while block 'c' supports 'b' from below. The robot hand is currently engaged, holding block 'a'.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has block 'd' already stacked on top of block 'b', which in turn is on block 'c'. The goal state requires block 'd' to be on block 'c'. Achieving the goal would involve unstacking block 'd' from 'b' and restacking it onto 'c'. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a', which does not interfere directly with the required actions for achieving the goal. The hand could place block 'a' down and proceed with the necessary unstacking and restacking actions.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The current configuration and status of these objects are as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block B is on top of Block C and is also clear.
- Block C is on the table.
- The robot hand is holding Block D.

This setup provides the context needed for planning actions such as moving blocks or changing their configuration using the robot hand.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding Block D, and the goal is to have Block D placed on top of Block C. Currently, Block C is on the table and clear since Block B is on top of it but does not obstruct Block C. This setup is conducive to achieving the goal since the next logical action would be to put Block D down on Block C, aligning directly with the goal state requirements.

Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to place block D on top of block C. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D, and both blocks A and B are available for stacking. However, block C is not clear as block B is on top of it. Therefore, the first action should be aimed at freeing block C. Since block D is already in the robot's hand, the direct action needed to progress toward the goal is to put down block D so that the robot hand is free to manipulate other blocks.

Actions: put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default)

Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given that the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c', and considering that the robot hand is currently holding block 'd', the direct actions needed should focus on preparing block 'c' to receive block 'd'. However, block 'c' currently has block 'b' on top of it, which needs to be moved first. The valid actions include stacking 'd' onto 'b' or 'a', or putting 'd' down. Since stacking or putting down 'd' won't immediately help in achieving the goal, it seems necessary to first clear block 'c' by moving block 'b'. But directly related actions for moving 'b' are not listed as valid, so the next best step is to put down 'd' and then perform actions to clear 'c'.

Actions: put-down(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

- stack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the current state, Block D is held by the robot hand, and Block C is on the table but not clear because Block B is on top of it. Therefore, the action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' is invalid as Block C is not clear. To progress towards the goal of stacking Block D on Block C, the robot hand first needs to make Block C clear. This can be done by removing Block B from on top of Block C and then placing Block D on Block C.

Actions: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default)

Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to place block D on top of block C. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D. Block C is on the table and does not have any blocks on top, which makes it ready to receive block D directly. The valid actions include the possibility to stack block D on block B or A, or to put it down. However, to achieve the goal state directly and efficiently, the robot should first place block D down on the table (since there is no direct action available to stack D on C from the current hold), and then pick it up again to stack on C in a subsequent valid step.

Actions: put-down(d:default), pick-up(d:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: Action 'pick-up(d:default)' is not a valid action for the current state.

In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The current configuration and status of these objects are as follows:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.

- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the goal of placing Block D on top of Block C, and the current state where the robot hand is holding Block D, the most direct action is to stack Block D on Block C. However, Block C is currently not clear because Block B is on top of it. The first action needed is to move Block B from Block C. Since Block B is clear and on top of Block C, the next valid action could include picking up Block B if it were possible, but the robot hand is currently holding Block D. Therefore, the first action should be to put down Block D in a position that doesn't interfere with the subsequent move of Block B. Placing Block D on the table is a suitable action. After putting down Block D, the robot hand will be free to manipulate Block B.

Actions: put-down(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

- Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- Block B is positioned on top of Block C.
- Block A is on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any block. 

This setup forms a sequence of stacks and positions that the robot can interact with to rearrange the blocks according to a specified goal.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block D is already stacked on block B, which is on top of block C. To achieve the goal state where block D is directly on block C, the steps required would be to unstack block A from D, then unstack block D from B, and finally stack block D directly on block C. Since the robot hand is empty, it is ready to perform these actions without any need to put down a block first. This indicates that the current state is conducive to reaching the goal state through a series of straightforward actions.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The configuration and status of these objects are as follows:

1. Block C is on the table.
2. Block A is on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
3. The robotic hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
4. Block D is clear and is positioned on top of Block B.
5. Block B is stacked on top of Block C.

This setup forms a structure where Blocks B and D are stacked vertically with C at the base on the table, while Block A is separate and directly on the table.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block 'd' placed on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block D is already stacked on top of Block B, which is itself on top of Block C. The goal state requires Block D to be directly on top of Block C. This implies that Block B needs to be moved from its current position between D and C. The robot's hand is empty, which is beneficial as it can be used to rearrange the blocks. The first step would involve unstacking D from B, followed by either moving B to a different location (such as on the table or onto another block like A) and then stacking D directly onto C. Given that the robotic hand is empty and the blocks are in positions that allow for these movements, the current state is conducive to achieving the goal state.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have block 'd' on top of block 'c'. Currently, block 'd' is already on top of block 'b', which is on top of 'c'. This means that the structure required in the goal is partially completed. The robot hand is holding block 'a', which does not interfere with the goal of stacking 'd' on 'c'. The necessary next steps might involve repositioning block 'b' and ensuring 'd' ends up on 'c', either directly from the current configuration or by rearranging the blocks through intermediate steps. Thus, the current state is quite close to the goal configuration, requiring only a few changes.
