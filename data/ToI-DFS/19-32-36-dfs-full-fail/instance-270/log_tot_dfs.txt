ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block c is on top of block d, and block d is on top of block b. Block b is directly on the table. Block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The robot hand is currently holding block a. This setup is part of a system where blocks are manipulated to achieve specific configurations by stacking them on each other or placing them on the table, with the assistance of a robot hand capable of picking up and putting down these blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the goal for the robot is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration forms a circular stack involving blocks A, B, C, and D.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires a circular stack where A is on B, C is on D, and D is on A, which is physically impossible because it implies that block D would need to be simultaneously supporting and being supported by block A, creating an impossible loop. Given the current state where the robot is holding A, and C is on D which is on B, there is no sequence of actions that can lead to the described goal state because the necessary arrangement defies logical stacking rules.
