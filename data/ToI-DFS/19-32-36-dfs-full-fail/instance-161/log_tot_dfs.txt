ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, block C is placed on top of block A, and both blocks A and D are positioned on the table. Block D and block C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block B. This setup defines the state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment is to position block B on top of block C and block D on top of block B, achieving a specific configuration of these blocks. This setup is part of a task where a robot hand manipulates these blocks, starting from an initial configuration and rearranging them to meet this goal.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have a stack where B is on C and D is on B. Currently, block C is on the table, block A is on the table, block D is clear, and the robot hand is holding B. Since B needs to be placed on C, the robot can directly perform this action since B is already in hand and C is clear. After placing B on C, the next step would be to position D on top of B, which is feasible since D is clear and can be picked up by the robot hand. The current setup does not have any major constraints or misplaced blocks that would prevent reaching the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block A is on the table.
- Block D is being held by the robot hand.
- Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment is to position block B on top of block C and block D on top of block B, achieving a specific configuration of these blocks. This setup is part of a task where a robot hand manipulates these blocks, starting from an initial configuration and rearranging them to meet this goal.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows Block B already on top of Block C, which aligns directly with the goal state requirements. The robot hand is currently holding Block D, which is also advantageous as the next step would logically be to stack Block D on top of Block B, completing the desired configuration. Since the current state is already partially fulfilling the goal and the next steps to reach the full goal state are straightforward and achievable with the current block positions, it appears very likely that the current state is on the path to the goal state.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of a Blocksworld scenario with a robot hand, the blocks named A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:

- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block A is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.
- Block D is the only block that is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.

This setup describes a stack of blocks with a clear hierarchy from A at the bottom on the table, ascending to D at the top, and the robot hand available to manipulate the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in the described environment is to position block B on top of block C and block D on top of block B, achieving a specific configuration of these blocks. This setup is part of a task where a robot hand manipulates these blocks, starting from an initial configuration and rearranging them to meet this goal.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has Block B on top of Block C and Block D on top of Block B, which is exactly the configuration required in the goal state. The robot hand is empty, implying no mid-manipulation process is ongoing. The configuration described in the current state directly matches the goal state, indicating that no further actions are necessary to achieve the goal.
