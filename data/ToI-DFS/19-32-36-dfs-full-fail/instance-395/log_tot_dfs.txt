ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, block 'a' is placed on top of block 'd', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. Block 'a' is also clear, meaning no other block is on top of it. Block 'b' is positioned directly on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block 'c'. The objects involved in this scenario are blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current objective is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A, creating a specific configuration with these blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state describes block 'a' on top of block 'd', block 'd' on top of block 'b', and block 'c' being held by the robot hand. The goal state, however, requires a different configuration where block 'A' is on top of block 'C', block 'B' is on top of block 'D', and block 'D' on top of block 'A'. This goal configuration seems impossible or contradictory as block 'D' cannot be both under block 'B' and on top of block 'A' simultaneously. Given the goal's inconsistency, the current state cannot be on the path to achieving such a configuration.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration and status of each:
- Block D is clear and is placed on top of Block B.
- Block C is clear and is on the table.
- Block B is on the table but has Block D on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block A.

This summary describes the position of each block and the status of the robot hand in relation to the blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current objective is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A, creating a specific configuration with these blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This presents a logical inconsistency, as block D cannot simultaneously be under block B and on top of block A. Therefore, if this description of the goal state is accurate, reaching this configuration is logically impossible due to the physical impossibility of the described arrangement.
