ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, block C is on the table and clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it. Block A is also on the table and clear. The robot hand is holding block B. This setup indicates that block B is not on the table or under another block, as it is being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, and block B is on top of block C. This configuration will satisfy the goal state for the agent to achieve.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block B while blocks A and C are on the table and clear. To reach the goal state, where block A is on top of block B and block B is on top of block C, the robot hand needs to perform specific actions in sequence. The next logical step would be to put down block B on top of block C since both are clear and accessible. After this, the robot can pick up block A and stack it on block B. The current state effectively sets up the scenario for these actions to be executed, indicating a clear path toward achieving the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have three objects: block 'a', block 'b', and block 'c'. The current state of affairs with these blocks is as follows:

1. Block 'b' is situated on top of block 'c'.
2. Block 'b' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
3. Block 'c' is directly on the table.
4. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'.

This setup outlines the positions and status of each block and the action of the robot hand in the scenario.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, and block B is on top of block C. This configuration will satisfy the goal state for the agent to achieve.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block 'b' is already on top of block 'c', which aligns with the goal state's requirement for block 'b' to be below block 'a'. The robot hand is holding block 'a', which is advantageous as the next step required to achieve the goal state is placing 'a' on top of 'b'. Since the current state already partially matches the goal state and the robotâ€™s next actions are straightforward and directly lead towards the final desired configuration, the current state seems to be effectively on the path to achieving the goal state.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- put-down(a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given scenario, the environment involves a robot hand and three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, the robot hand is empty. Block C is placed on the table, and Block B is on top of Block C. Both Blocks A and B are also on the table and have nothing on them, which means they are clear and ready to be moved or stacked.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, and block B is on top of block C. This configuration will satisfy the goal state for the agent to achieve.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state describes that the robot hand is empty, which is suitable for picking up blocks. Block C is correctly placed on the table as per the goal state, but Block B is incorrectly placed directly on top of Block C instead of Block A being directly above Block B. Furthermore, Block A, which should be on top of the stack according to the goal state, is currently on the table. To reach the goal state, actions would need to be taken to rearrange these blocks: Block B needs to be moved from its current position and Block A then needs to be stacked on Block B, which in turn needs to be stacked on Block C. The current configuration is a workable starting point, but several steps are required to reach the desired goal state.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the robot's hand is empty. There are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block C is placed on the table, while Block B is directly on top of Block C, and Block A is stacked on top of Block B. Furthermore, Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. This setup allows for actions such as moving Block A since it is clear, or manipulating Block B or C with further actions if Block A is moved first.
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, and block B is on top of block C. This configuration will satisfy the goal state for the agent to achieve.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state already matches the goal state, as described. In the current state, Block A is on top of Block B, and Block B is on top of Block C, with all blocks being clear where necessary. This arrangement is exactly what the goal state requires.
