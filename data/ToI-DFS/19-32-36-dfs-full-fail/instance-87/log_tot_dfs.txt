ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, as well as a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

1. Block C is placed on top of Block D.
2. Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
3. The robot hand is holding Block B.
4. Block D is on the table.
5. Block A is placed on top of Block C.

This setup provides a snapshot of the positions and the status of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to rearrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This specific arrangement of blocks needs to be achieved to meet the objective.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that Block A is already on top of Block C, which matches part of the goal state. However, the goal also requires Block B to be on top of Block D and Block D to be on top of Block A, which means Block D should be underneath both Block A and Block B. This arrangement is physically impossible because a block cannot be both at the top and the bottom simultaneously in a stack. Therefore, the goal state described is unachievable based on the rules of the Blocksworld domain.
