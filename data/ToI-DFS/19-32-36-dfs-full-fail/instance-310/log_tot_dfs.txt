ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block D is on top of Block B and Block D is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
- Block C is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block A is clear and is positioned on the table.
- Block B is also directly on the table.

No additional goals have been specified. This scenario is set up for manipulating the blocks, potentially to achieve a different configuration using the actions available such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state specified seems to be an impossible configuration since it involves block A being both on top of block C and underneath block D simultaneously, which cannot occur in a physical setup where each block can only be in one position at a time. Therefore, regardless of the actions taken in the current state, the goal state cannot be achieved due to its contradictory nature.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and their relationships are as follows:
- Block C is placed on top of Block A.
- Block D is being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks A and B are positioned on the table.
- Blocks B and C are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state specifies a stack configuration where A is on C, B is on D, and D is on A, which seems contradictory and impossible based on the rules of physics and the Blocksworld game rules. You cannot have both A on C and D on A, as this would require A to be both above and below another block at the same time. Therefore, the current state cannot be evaluated as being on the path to the specified goal state because the goal state itself is unachievable with the given constraints.
