VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot's status is as follows:

1. Block a is clear and is placed on the table.
2. Block b is currently being held by the robot's hand.
3. Block c is also on the table.
4. Block d is clear and is stacked on top of block c.

This setup outlines the initial state of the blocks relative to each other and the robot's interaction with them.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot is holding block b, and blocks a, c, and d are in positions that do not directly align with the goal configuration. To reach the goal state where block a is on top of d, and c on top of a, the robot must execute several steps:
1. Put down block b (since it's not mentioned in the goal state's final configuration).
2. Unstack block d from c since block d needs to be at the bottom of the stack in the goal.
3. Stack block a on block d.
4. Stack block c on block a.

The current state does not preclude any of these actions from happening and is actually a reasonable starting point because block d, which needs to be at the bottom of the final stack, is already clear (except for needing to be unstacked from c), and block a is also clear. The robot's hand being full is a minor obstacle since it can simply put down block b and proceed with the necessary stacking actions.

Rating: maybe

The current state is potentially on the path to the goal state, but the correct sequence of actions is crucial, and there are intermediate steps needed that involve handling block b appropriately and rearranging blocks c and d.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block b is placed on top of block d.
2. Block c is positioned directly on the table.
3. Block d is on top of block c.
4. Block b is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
5. The robot hand is currently holding block a.

This setup involves a stack where block d is on block c, and block b is positioned on top of block d, with block c serving as the base of the stack on the table. The robot's hand is occupied with block a, indicating it's not available for other operations until it releases or places block a somewhere.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that blocks b, c, and d are in a vertical stack with b on top of d, and d on top of c. However, the goal state requires a different configuration where block a is on top of d, and c is on top of a. The robot hand is holding block a, which is advantageous because it is immediately available to be placed as needed for achieving the goal state. The next logical steps would include placing a on d and then positioning c on a. Considering that block c is already on the table and clear, it can be easily moved on top of a once a is placed correctly. The main challenge would be to reposition block b, as it currently occupies the top of d and would need to be moved elsewhere to allow a to be placed on d.

Rating: maybe

The current state is not directly in line with the goal state but includes elements that are necessary for progress towards the goal, such as the availability of block a in the robot's hand and block c being clear and on the table. However, some reconfiguration of blocks, particularly moving b, is required to align completely with the goal state. The presence of necessary elements and the robot's current action capability suggest that transitioning to the goal state is feasible but not guaranteed without further actions to adjust the placement of blocks.

In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and a table. Here's the current configuration of these items:

- Block b is on top of block d.
- Block d is directly on top of block c.
- Blocks a and c are directly on the table.
- Blocks a and b are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty, indicating that it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup is suitable for the robot to perform actions such as picking up block a or block b, or manipulating other blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'c' is on top of block 'a', and block 'a' is on top of block 'd', the current configuration needs significant rearranging. Currently, block 'b' is on top of block 'd', and block 'd' is on top of block 'c'. To get to the goal, block 'b' will need to be moved away from block 'd', and block 'd' also needs to be moved to make it the base for block 'a'. Block 'a', which is currently on the table, is clear and can be moved easily. The robot hand being empty is beneficial as it allows immediate action. However, since block 'd' is not in a position to directly receive block 'a', and changes need to be made with the positions of both block 'b' and block 'd', the current state requires several intermediate steps to reach the goal.

2. Block A is on top of Block B.
3. Block D is on top of Block C.
4. Block C is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.
6. Block A is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.

This setup presents a stack of blocks with a specific order and positioning, along with the readiness of the robot hand to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current configuration where Block B is on Block D, and Block D is on Block C, while Block A is clear and on top of Block B, does not align straightforwardly with the goal configuration where Block D is at the bottom, Block A is in the middle, and Block C is on top. Achieving the goal will require several steps, including repositioning Block B and the correct stacking of Blocks A, C, and D. Since the robot hand is empty and Block A is clear, there's potential to start reconfiguring the blocks to reach the goal state, but it will involve multiple actions such as unstacking and restacking.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state presents an initial setup where block b is on top of block d, block c is directly on the table, and block d is placed on block c. Importantly, the robot hand is holding block a. For achieving the goal state where block 'a' should be on top of block 'd', and block 'c' on top of 'a', several actions are required. First, block b needs to be moved away from its current position on block d to clear the way for arranging block a on d. Following this, the robot can place block a on block d. Subsequently, block c, which is already on the table, can be moved to the top of block a. The current holding of block a by the robot hand suggests that an immediate next step could involve placing block a in the required position on block d, after relocating block b. This sequence aligns well with required actions to gradually establish the goal configuration.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a', a sequence of strategic actions must be taken. Currently, the robot is holding block 'b'. Since block 'd' is clear and part of the final configuration (as the base of the stack with 'a' on it), a logical first step would be to place block 'b' in a position that does not interfere with the final stack configuration. The valid actions suggest that block 'b' can be stacked on 'd', but this would impede later stacking 'a' on 'd'. Thus, the best move is to put down 'b' on the table, clearing the way for manipulating 'a' and 'd'.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block 'a' to be stacked on 'd' and block 'c' on 'a'. Currently, block 'b' is held by the robot, and the valid actions allow for stacking 'b' on 'a' or 'd', or putting 'b' down. Since stacking 'b' now does not directly help in achieving the goal configuration, putting 'b' down would free the robot to manipulate other blocks necessary to reach the goal. After putting 'b' down, the next move would ideally be picking up 'a' to prepare it for stacking on 'd'.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'a' is on block 'd' and block 'c' is on block 'a', a pre-requisite is that block 'a' must be positioned over block 'd'. Currently, the robot is holding block 'b', and block 'd' is available to have another block stacked on it. The first logical action is to stack block 'b' on top of block 'd', making block 'd' not clear. Subsequently, to proceed towards the goal configuration, the robot will need to manipulate block 'a'. However, before block 'a' can be moved or stacked, the robot's hand must be empty. Thus, the second action should be to unstack block 'b' from block 'd' (after stacking it in the first action), which will make both block 'b' and block 'd' clear and free the robot’s hand for future moves.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a', we need to consider the current state and valid actions. Currently, block b is in the robot's hand, which suggests that we first need to put block b down to free up the robot's hand. After putting down b, the robot can then pick up block a, as block a is clear and on the table, setting up for the subsequent stacking of a onto d.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To work towards the goal state where block 'a' needs to be on top of block 'd', I need to first free up block 'a' since it is currently on the table. Block 'b' is in the robot's hand, so it can be used to initiate a stacking sequence without any further pickups. The valid action available is to stack 'b' on 'd', which is a strategic step because it does not directly interfere with the final goal positioning of 'a' and 'c'. After placing 'b' on 'd', block 'a' is already clear, so the next step could involve moving 'c' onto 'a' or further rearranging to achieve the goal configuration.

Think: In the current state, block D is stacked on block C, and blocks A and B are clear on the table. To reach the goal state, where block C is on top of block A, and block A is on top of block D, several actions need to be performed. Firstly, block D needs to be unstacked from block C. Then, block A must be stacked on block D. Finally, block C must be stacked on block A. Since the robot's hand is empty, it is poised to perform these actions, starting with unstacking block D from block C.

- Blocks a and c are directly on the table.
- Blocks a and b are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

VALUE RESPONSE 2

Think: The current state shows that blocks a, b, and c are each in positions that do not directly align with their placement in the goal state. To reach the goal configuration where 'c' is on top of 'a' and 'a' is on top of 'd', several moves will be necessary. Currently, 'b' is on top of 'd', which is not needed in the goal state, so 'b' will have to be moved. Furthermore, 'a' needs to be stacked on 'd', and 'c' needs to be stacked on 'a'. Given the robot hand is empty, it is feasible to start these operations, such as by moving 'b' first to clear the way for restructuring 'a', 'c', and 'd'. Hence, although the current state is not the goal state, it contains all necessary elements and is amenable to rearrangement towards the goal configuration.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block 'a' on top of 'd', and 'c' on top of 'a'. The current state has the robot holding 'a', and 'd' is accessible under 'c'. To reach the goal, the robot would need to put down 'a', unstack 'd' from 'c', then stack 'a' on 'd', and finally stack 'c' on 'a'. The fact that the robot is already holding 'a' is beneficial because it can proceed to rearrange the other blocks as needed without additional pickups initially. However, rearranging 'd' and 'c' will be necessary but is straightforward since 'c' is already on top and clear. The steps required to reach the goal are logical and follow from the current state with no contradictions or blocks in positions that would prevent progress.

Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2

Think: The current state presents all blocks (A, B, C, and D) clear on the table, and the robot hand is empty, which is a common starting point in Blocksworld problems. The goal state requires a specific stack of blocks with D at the bottom, A above D, and C on top of A. Since all blocks are clear and accessible, the robot can begin to build the stack immediately. The next actions would involve picking up block D, then block A to stack it on D, and finally picking up and stacking block C on A. The remaining block, B, does not interfere with achieving the goal as it can remain on the table.

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. All blocks A, B, C, and D are placed on the table. Each of these blocks is clear, indicating that there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty at the moment, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking any of the blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block 'c' is on top of 'a' which is on top of 'd', we first need to pick up blocks that will be part of the stack. Since the robot hand is empty, the initial action should involve picking up either block 'a' or 'c' because 'd' needs to stay on the table to be the base of the stack, and we can only stack one block at a time. Picking up 'a' first seems optimal as it allows subsequently stacking it on 'd', which matches the partial goal structure.

Actions: pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block 'c' is on top of block 'a' and block 'a' is on top of block 'd', the robot must first pick up blocks that will form the base and middle of the stack. Since all blocks are on the table and the robot hand is empty, the first logical step is to pick up block 'd' to eventually place 'a' on top of it. The second action should involve picking up block 'a', as it needs to be stacked on 'd'.

Think: The current state shows the robot hand holding block A, with blocks B, C, and D clear on the table. To reach the goal state, where block D is at the bottom, A is in the middle, and C is on top, the steps might include putting down block A, stacking block A on block D, and then stacking block C on block A. The current setup, with all blocks accessible and the robot hand already holding block A, is conducive to executing these steps efficiently. The primary challenge is to perform these steps in sequence without interference from other blocks, which is currently possible as B is not involved in the stacking process.

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the setup:

1. Block A is clear (no other block is on top of A) and it is placed on the table.
2. Block B is also on the table, but it has Block D placed on top of it. Block D is clear.
3. Block C is clear and on the table.
4. The robot hand is empty at the moment.

The arrangement allows for manipulation of the blocks by the robot hand to achieve any required configuration, with the actions available being to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state presents a relatively straightforward path to the goal state given the configuration and the actions available. Block A and Block C are clear and on the table, allowing them to be manipulated easily by the robot hand. Block D, although currently under Block B, is accessible for manipulation since the robot can unstack Block D from B. The robot's empty hand is also crucial as it provides the flexibility needed to perform the necessary actions.

The steps to potentially reach the goal configuration from the current state would involve:
1. Unstacking Block D from Block B (since D needs to be at the bottom of the stack in the goal state).
2. Picking up Block A and stacking it on Block D.
3. Picking up Block C and stacking it on Block A.

These actions fall within the capabilities defined by the current state and the actions allowed (pick up, put down, stack, unstack). Hence, the current state is conducive to progressing towards the goal state.

The current state is such that all blocks are either clear or can be readily made clear (by unstacking D from C), and the robot's hand is empty, which is the required condition to start picking up or unstacking blocks. The current state allows for these actions to be performed without additional rearrangements, making it conducive to reaching the goal state.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the robot needs to arrange block 'a' on top of 'd' and then stack 'c' on top of 'a'. Currently, block 'b' is in the robot's hand, which means the robot will need to put 'b' down first. Block 'd' is already in a position with 'c' on top, which complicates the placement of 'a' directly on 'd'. The robot would need to unstack 'd' from 'c', place 'b' somewhere (ideally on the table), then stack 'a' on 'd', and finally stack 'c' on 'a'. The current state does not directly align with the goal state, but there are clear steps that can be taken to rearrange the blocks accordingly.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state from the current state, several actions are required. Firstly, block D, which is already on the table and clear, should remain there. Block A needs to be placed on top of block D, and block C must be stacked on top of block A. This means reconfiguring the current setup where block B is on top of A and block D is clear. Since the robot's hand is empty, it can start by unstacking block B from block A. After this, it can pick up block A (once it is clear) and stack it onto block D. Finally, block C, which is already clear and on the table, can be picked up and stacked onto block A. This sequence of actions is logical and follows directly from the current state, indicating that the current state is a potential starting point on the path to the goal state.

Think: The current state shows block b being held by the robot, while blocks a, c, and d are either on the table or stacked (d on c). The goal state requires d at the bottom with a stacked on it, and then c on top of a. Given b is currently held and not involved in the final stack, it can be placed down without affecting the goal stack.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To make progress towards the goal state, where block A needs to be on D and C on top of A, it's essential to first free up block A since it is currently underneath block B. The robot is holding block D, hence stacking D first or putting it down is a viable option. Stacking D on C directly doesn't help achieve the goal configuration directly, and putting D down would free the robot's hand but doesn't progress towards stacking. Stacking D under B (which is on top of A) might lead to a more complex rearrangement later. Therefore, the best action is to stack D under B to form a base and then unstack B from A to free A for the next steps.

5. The robot hand is currently holding Block A.

These conditions determine the current configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)
- put-down(a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, the actions chosen need to facilitate the final configuration of block 'a' on top of block 'd', followed by block 'c' on top of block 'a'. Currently, the robot hand holds block 'a', and block 'd' is clear and on top of block 'B'. The first step should involve placing block 'a' onto block 'd' to move towards the desired stack formation. Once block 'a' is on 'd', block 'c', which is clear and on the table, can then be stacked on top of block 'a'.

Actions: stack(a:default,d:default), stack(c:default,a:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: Action 'stack(c:default,a:default)' is not a valid action for the current state.
Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and the following conditions are observed:

1. Block D is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
2. Block C is on the table and is also clear.
3. Block B is on the table.
4. Block D is positioned on top of Block B.
5. The robot hand is currently holding Block A.

These conditions determine the current configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- stack(a:default,c:default)

Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block 'a' to be on top of block 'd', and block 'c' to be on top of block 'a'. Currently, the robot hand is holding block 'a', and both block 'd' and 'c' are clear. The first step should involve stacking 'a' on 'd' to align with part of the goal state. Following this, block 'c' can then be stacked on 'a' to achieve the full goal configuration. However, I can propose only two actions now. The first action should be to stack 'a' on 'd' as this aligns directly with the goal state requirement. The second action could be to prepare for the next move, which will be stacking 'c' on 'a'. This preparation involves no further action since 'c' is already clear and on the table.

Actions: stack(a:default,d:default), stack(a:default,c:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently empty. Here is the configuration of the blocks:

- Block A is on top of Block C and Block A is clear.
- Block D is on top of Block B and Block D is clear.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.

This configuration implies that Blocks A and D can be manipulated by the robot since they are clear, and the robot's hand is free to pick up a block.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state from the current state, the following steps seem necessary:
1. Unstack Block A from Block C.
2. Put down Block A on the table.
3. Unstack Block D from Block B.
4. Pick up Block A and stack it on Block D.
5. Pick up Block C and stack it on Block A.
Currently, Blocks A and D are clear and can be manipulated, which aligns with the requirements for reordering them as per the goal state. The robot's hand is free, which is essential for picking up the blocks. Although several steps are needed, the current configuration allows for these actions to be sequentially executed to reach the goal.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the configuration of blocks is such that block A is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. Block C is directly on the table. Both blocks A and C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup is part of the initial state in a planning problem where the goal is typically to rearrange the blocks to achieve a desired configuration using a set of allowable actions.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has block A on top of block D, which matches part of the goal state configuration where block A needs to be on top of block D. However, in the goal state, block C needs to be on top of block A. Currently, block C is on the table and not stacked on any block. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it can perform necessary actions like picking up and stacking block C on A without needing to first put down another block. The current configuration supports a direct pathway to achieving the goal state by stacking C on A.

VALUE PROMPT 1

Current State:
The current environment consists of four objects, labeled as a, b, c, and d, which are likely blocks in a Blocksworld scenario. Here is a summary of the state based on the given predicates:

1. Block a is on top of block d.
2. Block a is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
3. The robot hand is currently holding block c.
4. Block b is directly on the table.
5. Block d is on top of block b.

This setup forms a scenario where blocks are arranged in a specific configuration, with the robot hand involved in manipulating these blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has block 'a' already on top of block 'd', which is part of the goal state configuration. However, block 'c' is currently held by the robot hand instead of being on top of block 'a'. To progress towards the goal state, the robot would need to put down block 'c' and then stack it on top of block 'a'. Since block 'a' is clear, this action is feasible. The remainder of the configuration (block 'b' on the table and block 'd' under 'a') already matches the goal state description.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and the following conditions are observed:

1. Block D is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
2. Block C is on the table and is also clear.
3. Block B is on the table.
4. Block D is positioned on top of Block B.
5. The robot hand is currently holding Block A.

These conditions determine the current configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange some blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This setup forms a stack with 'd' at the bottom, 'a' in the middle, and 'c' on top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block D on top of block B, and the robot hand is holding block A. Block C is clear on the table. To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block A, and A is on top of block D, the following steps would be needed:
1. Put down block A onto the table or directly onto block D if positioning allows.
2. Unstack block D from block B and place it on the table, assuming no direct stacking is possible due to the configuration.
3. Pick up block A and stack it on block D.
4. Finally, pick up block C and stack it on block A.

Since these actions are feasible given the current state and directly contribute to arranging the blocks per the goal state, the current state seems to be on the path to achieving the goal state.
