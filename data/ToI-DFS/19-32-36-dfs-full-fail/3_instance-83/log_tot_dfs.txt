ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block 'c' is positioned on the table and nothing is stacked on it, making it clear.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the ultimate goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block B is on top of block A. The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate one block at a time. The robot can execute actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another to achieve the desired configuration of blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state describes a situation where block 'a' is in the robot hand, and blocks 'b' and 'c' are on the table and clear. To achieve the goal state where block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'b' is on top of block 'a', the sequence of moves would include putting down block 'a' on block 'c' first, and then stacking block 'b' on block 'a'. Since the robot is already holding 'a', and 'c' is clear on the table, the robot can immediately perform a stack action to place 'a' on 'c'. After this, the robot can pick up 'b' and stack it on 'a'. Thus, the current state is conducive for achieving the goal state with a few direct actions.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot hand is currently holding block b. Block a is positioned on top of block c, and block c is directly on the table. Additionally, block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The objects involved in this scenario are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the ultimate goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block B is on top of block A. The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate one block at a time. The robot can execute actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another to achieve the desired configuration of blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state is already partway towards the goal state since block A is on top of block C, as required by the goal state. The only action needed is to stack block B on top of block A. Since the robot hand is already holding block B, this is a straightforward next step. Thus, the current state appears to be on the direct path to achieving the goal state.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- put-down(b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating that it is not holding any blocks. Block C is positioned on the table, and Block B is also on the table. Block A is stacked on top of Block C. Both Block A and Block B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. This setup is crucial for planning the robot's actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the ultimate goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block B is on top of block A. The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate one block at a time. The robot can execute actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another to achieve the desired configuration of blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has block A already on top of block C, which aligns partially with the goal state that requires block A to be on top of block C. However, the goal state also requires block B to be on top of block A. In the current state, block B is clear and on the table, ready to be moved. Given that block A is already in the correct position on top of C, the robot can directly perform the action stack(B, A) to move towards the goal state, assuming no obstructions in performing this action.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, block B is on top of block A, and block A is on top of block C. Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block C is on the table. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.

Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the ultimate goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block B is on top of block A. The environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate one block at a time. The robot can execute actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another to achieve the desired configuration of blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block A on top of block C, with block B on top of block A. In the current state, block B is already on top of block A, and block A is on top of block C. This configuration matches exactly with the goal state configuration. The only action that might be required is verification that the robot hand remains empty, which it currently is.
