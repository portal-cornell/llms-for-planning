ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, block A and block D are on the table. Block B is placed on top of block A and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block B. The robot hand is holding block C, and block D is also clear. This setup allows for various actions such as moving blocks or placing them in different configurations using the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on block A, block C is on block D, and block D is on block B. This setup forms a particular stacking order that the robot needs to achieve using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state appears to have a logical inconsistency, as it describes a circular configuration where block D is both directly under block C and on top of block B, creating an impossible structure. Therefore, no actions or sequences of actions can lead from the current state to the stated goal since the goal itself is not achievable with the physical constraints of the environment.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand are as follows:

- Block c is placed on top of block b.
- Block b is directly on top of block a.
- Block a is resting on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.
- Block c is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

This setup involves these blocks and the robot's interaction, forming a vertical stack with a, b, and c, while the robot is engaged with block d.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on block A, block C is on block D, and block D is on block B. This setup forms a particular stacking order that the robot needs to achieve using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block d, which is an advantageous position since the goal state involves block d being part of the stack under block c. The current stack (a, b, c) must be rearranged to meet the goal configuration. The robot can start by placing block d on the table or stack it immediately if the situation allows. The significant rearrangement required is for block c to move from being on top of block b to being on top of block d, and then b must be rearranged to rest on a. The current state shows potential as it has all blocks accounted for and in a manageable configuration to transition to the goal state. The main tasks involve rearranging the blocks in a sequence that might include intermediate steps like repositioning blocks temporarily on the table or adjusting the stack order.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(d:default,c:default)
- put-down(d:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block A, making A the base of this stack.
- Block D is placed directly on the table.
- Block A is also directly on the table.
- Both Blocks C and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the spatial arrangement and availability of the blocks for manipulation by the robot hand to achieve any specified goal within this blocks world scenario.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on block A, block C is on block D, and block D is on block B. This setup forms a particular stacking order that the robot needs to achieve using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that blocks C and D are clear, and the robot hand is empty, which is suitable for initiating movement actions like picking up or stacking. To reach the goal state where block B is on block A, block C is on block D, and block D is on block B, several steps need to be taken. The current configuration of block C on top of B, and B on top of A, means that B and A are already in a partial goal state (ignoring that B needs to support D in the goal state). To achieve the full goal state, Block C needs to be moved to allow Block D to be placed on Block B. However, the goal configuration is not feasible as described (block D cannot be both directly on block B and have block C on top of it simultaneously unless there are auxiliary support mechanisms or additional blocks not mentioned). Hence, reaching the exact goal state from the current state seems logically inconsistent based on the capabilities described (simple stacking and moving).

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block c is stacked on top of block b.
2. Block d is stacked on top of block c.
3. Block b is stacked on top of block a.
4. Block a is placed directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.
6. Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

This setup indicates a vertical sequence of blocks with d at the top, followed by c, b, and a at the base, directly on the table. The robot hand is not holding any blocks and is ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on block A, block C is on block D, and block D is on block B. This setup forms a particular stacking order that the robot needs to achieve using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows a vertical stack of blocks from a to d, with the robot hand empty. The goal state requires a reconfiguration where block B is on block A, block C is on block D, and block D is on block B, which implies a circular stacking. To move from the current state to the goal state, several actions are needed, such as unstacking blocks d and c from their current positions and restacking them according to the goal configuration. Given that the robot hand is empty and ready to perform actions, and considering that all blocks are accessible (with block d clear and readily movable), the current state seems to be on a feasible path towards achieving the goal state through a series of correct actions.

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand are as follows:

- Block c is placed on top of block b.
- Block b is directly on top of block a.
- Block a is resting on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.
- Block c is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

This setup involves these blocks and the robot's interaction, forming a vertical stack with a, b, and c, while the robot is engaged with block d.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on block A, block C is on block D, and block D is on block B. This setup forms a particular stacking order that the robot needs to achieve using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block a is on the table with block b on top of it, and block c on top of block b, while the robot hand is holding block d. The goal state requires block b to be on block a, which is already achieved. However, block c needs to be on block d, and block d needs to be on block b. Given that the robot is currently holding block d, it can potentially place block d directly on block b, and then stack block c on block d. The formation of block b on block a aligns directly with the goal state, and the robot's current possession of block d allows for flexibility in achieving the required new stack.
