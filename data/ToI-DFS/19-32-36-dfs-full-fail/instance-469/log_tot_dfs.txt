ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(e:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, which involves a set of blocks (b, c, d, a, e) and a robot hand, the following conditions are present:

1. Block a is placed on top of block d.
2. Block c is positioned on top of block a.
3. The robot hand is holding block e.
4. Block d is on the table.
5. Block b is also on the table.
6. Both blocks c and b are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This setup forms part of a Blocksworld domain where the objective includes rearranging these blocks based on certain goals using a series of actions executed by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A, creating a specific configuration of blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state presents a configuration where blocks are arranged with block a on block d and block c on block a, while the robot hand holds block e. The goal state, however, requires a completely different arrangement where block A should be on block C, block B on block D, and block D on block A. The current configuration does not seem to be efficiently aligned with the goal state due to the contradictory positioning of blocks a and c, as well as blocks b and d. For instance, in the goal, block D should be on block A, which conflicts with the current placement of block A on block D. The goal implies a circular dependency (block D on A, and A on C) which is not feasible in this scenario as blocks cannot support circular stacking. Therefore, this is likely a misinterpretation or error in the goal statement.

Rating: impossible

Given the misalignment and the logical inconsistency in the goal description, the current state cannot be on the path to achieving the goal as stated. The structure of the goal itself needs revision for any progress to be possible.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocks World scenario, we have five blocks named a, b, c, d, and e. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block a is on block d.
- Block c is on block a.
- Block e is on block c.
- Block d is positioned directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block b.
- Block e is the only block that is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of it.

This setup involves a stacked structure with blocks a, c, and e forming a vertical stack on top of block d, while the robot hand is occupied with block b.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A, creating a specific configuration of blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that blocks a, c, and e form a vertical stack on block d, and the robot's hand is holding block b. The goal state, however, requires a different arrangement where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This configuration indicates a circular dependency which is not possible in a physical Blocks World scenario because a block cannot be simultaneously on top of and under the same block (e.g., A on C and D on A simultaneously). Therefore, the described goal state is logically impossible to achieve given the constraints of the environment.
