ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The block B is placed on top of block D, and both blocks A and D are situated on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block C. Additionally, blocks A and B are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block C, while block B is placed on block D, and both blocks A and D are on the table. The goal state requires block B to be on top of block C, block C on top of block A, and block D on top of block B. For this arrangement, the robot hand holding block C is advantageous as C needs to be placed on block A next. However, block B needs to be removed from block D and placed on C later. Block D incorrectly positioned under block B in the current state is a deviation from the goal, where D should be on top of B.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, block C is on top of block A, and both block A and block D are on the table. Block D and block C are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. The robot hand is holding block B.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has block C on top of block A and block D on the table, which aligns with part of the goal configuration. However, block B, which is currently held by the robot hand, should be stacked on top of block C according to the goal state. Additionally, block D should be on top of block B in the goal state, which is not currently the case. To move towards the goal state, the robot needs to put down block B and then either stack block B on C or rearrange block D and B accordingly. The presence of the correct base (C on A) and the availability of B and D to be moved indicates that the current state is on a possible path towards achieving the goal state, but some steps still need to be taken.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
The environment consists of four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, block C is on top of block A, and both block A and block D are on the table. Block D and block C are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. The robot hand is holding block B.
Valid Actions:
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- put-down(b:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the current state where the robot hand is holding block B and both block C and block D are clear, along with the goal state where block B needs to be on top of block C, the most direct action to progress towards the goal is to stack block B on block C. The second action should ideally build towards achieving the final configuration where block D should be on top of block B, but since currently block B will be on top of block C, block D cannot be stacked on B immediately. Thus, the second action should be a preparation for future moves, such as moving block D to a position where it can later be stacked on B once B is clear.

Actions: stack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and D are placed directly on the table. Block C is stacked on top of Block A. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks at the moment. Each of the blocks B, C, and D is clear, meaning there is nothing placed on top of them, allowing these blocks to be accessible for manipulation.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block C is already on top of Block A, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, the goal state requires Block B to be on top of Block C and Block D to be on top of Block B. Currently, Blocks B and D are on the table and not in the correct configuration. To reach the goal, the robot would need to stack B on C and then D on B. Given that the robot's hand is empty and all necessary blocks are clear and available for manipulation, the current state does allow for these actions to be performed. Therefore, it seems possible to move toward the goal state from the current configuration.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, block C is on top of block A, and block B is on top of block C. Both block A and block D are directly on the table. Blocks B and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state is already partway to the goal state, as block B is directly on top of block C, which is on top of block A. This matches the part of the goal state where B is on C and C is on A. However, the goal state requires block D to be stacked on top of block B, while currently, block D is on the table and clear. With the robot hand empty, the next logical actions could involve picking up block D and stacking it on top of block B.

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, block C is on top of block A, and both block A and block D are on the table. Block D and block C are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. The robot hand is holding block B.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state already has block C on top of block A, which is a part of the desired goal state configuration. The robot hand is currently holding block B, which is correctly positioned to be placed on top of block C. However, the goal state requires block D to be on top of block B, while currently, block D is on the table. To achieve the goal, the robot will need to put down block B on block C and then place block D on top of block B. This series of moves is feasible with the current state of the blocks and the actions available in the Blocksworld environment.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In this scenario from the Blocksworld domain, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Hereâ€™s how the environment is set up:

- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block C.
- Block A is positioned directly on the table.
- Block B is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

This configuration involves multiple blocks on top of each other with one block being held by the robot, indicating an intermediate state in block manipulation.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state and the goal state are very close in configuration. The goal is to have B on C, C on A, and D on B, which matches the current positioning of A, B, and C. The only difference is that D is currently being held by the robot hand instead of being stacked on B. Since D is already held by the robot, the next logical step would be to stack D on B, which directly leads to the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the configuration of the blocks is as follows: Block C is on Block A, Block B is on Block C, and Block D is on Block B. Block A is directly on the table. Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block B. This arrangement will create a stack where each block supports another, achieving the desired configuration for the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state describes Block C on Block A, Block B on Block C, and Block D on Block B, with Block A on the table. The goal state requires Block B on Block C, Block C on Block A, Block D on Block B, and all on the table, in that specific order. Comparing the current state and the goal state, they are identical. Block A supports Block C, which supports Block B, which supports Block D. Block D is clear, and the robot's hand is empty, which matches the necessary conditions for the goal state. Therefore, the current state is already the goal state.
