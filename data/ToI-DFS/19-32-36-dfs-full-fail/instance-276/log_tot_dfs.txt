ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, we have a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current state of these blocks:

- Block A is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block B is placed on top of Block C and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of Block B.
- Block C is on the table.
- Block D is also on the table and is clear.

This setup outlines the arrangement and status of each block with respect to their positions and interactions with the table and the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This setup may require repositioning the blocks such that they are stacked in the specified order to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has the robot's hand holding Block A, with Blocks B and C in a stack and Block D clear on the table. The goal state requires a cyclic configuration where A is on C, B is on D, and D is on A, which is impossible to achieve as it forms a loop (A on C, D on A) that violates the rules of physics and the game. No sequence of legal moves can lead to the goal state described as it contains inherent contradictions and physical impossibilities.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, which consists of a robot hand and several blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, the following conditions are present:

1. The robot hand is holding block D.
2. Block C is positioned on the table.
3. Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
4. Block B is placed directly on top of Block C.
5. Block A is positioned on top of Block B.

This setting forms a stack with Block C at the base, Block B in the middle, and Block A at the top, while Block D is being held by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This setup may require repositioning the blocks such that they are stacked in the specified order to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state and the goal state involve different configurations of the blocks. In the current state, the robot hand is holding Block D, and there is a stack consisting of C at the base, B in the middle, and A on top. The goal requires a configuration where A is on C, B is on D, and D is on A, which is a circular arrangement and logically impossible as no block can be both under and above another block at the same time. Therefore, the described goal state is unachievable from the current state or any other starting configuration.
