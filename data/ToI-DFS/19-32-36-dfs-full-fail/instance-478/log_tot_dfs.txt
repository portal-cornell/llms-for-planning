[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld scenario, the environment comprises five blocks labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. Hereâ€™s the current state of the blocks and the robot's hand:

1. Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block d is on top of block e.
3. The robot's hand is holding block c.
4. Block e is on top of block a.
5. Block a is on top of block b.
6. Block b is placed directly on the table.

This configuration indicates a vertical stack from the table upward involving blocks b, a, e, and d, with block c being held by the robot's hand.
Goal State:
The goal in the Blocksworld environment is to arrange a specific configuration of blocks. Specifically, block A should be stacked on block D, block B on block E, and block E on block A. This configuration forms a particular structure with blocks A, B, D, and E.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal states that block A should be stacked on block D, block B on block E, and block E on block A, which forms a circular structure not typically achievable in a standard blocks-world domain due to physical constraints and the nature of stable stacking (i.e., a block cannot be both above and below another block). The current state does not appear to be on a path that could lead to this goal state under normal blocks-world rules. The current stacking order and the robot's hand status (holding block C) do not align with any part of the described goal configuration.
