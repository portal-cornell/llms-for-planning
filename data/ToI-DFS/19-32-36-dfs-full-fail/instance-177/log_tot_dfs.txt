ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. Block c is positioned on top of block d. The robot hand is currently holding block a. Block c is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it. Both block d and block b are on the table, and block b is also clear, indicating it has nothing on top of it.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block A is placed on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A, creating a specific configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal configuration is logically impossible to achieve as described. The goal states that block A should be on top of block C, and simultaneously, block D should be on top of block A. This creates a circular dependency which cannot be realized because a block cannot be both above and below another block at the same time. This contradiction means that, from the current state (or any state), reaching the described goal state is not feasible.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Currently, block 'd' is clear and placed on the table. Similarly, block 'a' is clear and is positioned on top of block 'b'. Block 'b' itself is directly on the table. The robot hand is holding block 'c'. This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with 'a' on 'b', while 'd' and 'b' are on the table, and 'c' is being held by the robot hand, with both 'a' and 'd' being clear and available for further actions.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block A is placed on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A, creating a specific configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block 'A' on 'C', 'B' on 'D', and 'D' on 'A', which contains a logical contradiction since no block can be both on top of and below another block simultaneously. Given this logical inconsistency, the goal state as described is unachievable from any current state, including the one described.
