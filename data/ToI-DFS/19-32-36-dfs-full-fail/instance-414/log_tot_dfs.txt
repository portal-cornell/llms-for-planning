ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The block c is placed on top of block d, and block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block b is located on the table. Block d is on top of block b. The robot hand is currently holding block a. This setup forms part of a scenario where the blocks are arranged in specific positions, and the robot hand interacts with them to achieve a goal, possibly reconfiguring their setup.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C, achieving a specific configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state and the goal state have major structural differences in how the blocks are organized. In the current state, block c is on top of block d, and block a is in the robot's hand. According to the goal state, block B should be on top of block D, block C should be on top of block A, and block D should be on top of block C. This configuration contradicts itself (block D cannot be both under block B and on top of block C), indicating a possible error in describing the goal state. Nonetheless, assuming a correction where block D is under block B and block C is on top of block A, the current configuration still requires significant reordering: block a needs to be placed down, and blocks need to be rearranged properly. This is feasible with several moves but requires careful planning and action sequencing.

Rating: maybe

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- put-down(a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the setup:

1. Block C is on top of Block D.
2. Block A is directly on the table.
3. Block D is on top of Block B.
4. Block B is also directly on the table.
5. Both Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
6. The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup of blocks and their positions, alongside the state of the robot hand, defines the current configuration in the Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C, achieving a specific configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state specifies the need for a specific stack order: B on D, C on A, and D on C. In the current configuration, the order of blocks is C on D and D on B, with A and B on the table. The blocks are not stacked in the required order for the goal state. However, the robot's hand is empty, which is advantageous as it allows for the picking up of blocks to rearrange them. To reach the goal state, substantial rearrangement is necessary, involving multiple operations, but the current state does not prohibit these changes.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The configuration of these blocks is as follows: Block C is on block D, Block A is directly on block C, and Block D is on block B. Block B is placed directly on the table. The robot's hand is currently empty, and Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C, achieving a specific configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state describes a stack where Block C is on Block D, Block A is on Block C, and Block D is on Block B. The goal state, however, requires Block B to be on top of Block D, Block C on top of Block A, and Block D on top of Block C. This suggests a need for rearranging most blocks as the current configuration does not align with the goal configuration. The robot's hand being empty is favorable as it allows immediate action on any block, particularly starting with Block A, which is already clear.

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the summary of the state:

1. Block D is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
2. Block A is also clear and is placed on the table.
3. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.
4. Block D is positioned on top of Block B.
5. Block B is also on the table.

This setup involves each block and the table, with the robot hand actively engaged by holding one of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C, achieving a specific configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that blocks D and B are already stacked, with D on top of B, which is a good start because part of the goal is to have B on top of D. However, the goal state desires an impossible configuration where block D is both directly on top of block B and block C at the same time, which cannot occur given the constraints of the environment where only one block can be directly on top of another. Furthermore, the robot hand holding block C prevents any direct stacking on C until it is put down. The described goal state appears to be fundamentally flawed or misstated based on the rules of the environment.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The block c is placed on top of block d, and block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block b is located on the table. Block d is on top of block b. The robot hand is currently holding block a. This setup forms part of a scenario where the blocks are arranged in specific positions, and the robot hand interacts with them to achieve a goal, possibly reconfiguring their setup.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C, achieving a specific configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state describes block c on top of block d, block b on the table, block d on top of block b, and the robot hand holding block a. The goal state requires block b on top of block d, block c on top of block a, and block d on top of block c. However, the current state has block d on top of block b, which is incompatible with the goal state of having block d on top of block c. Additionally, the position of block a (being held by the robot hand) and block c being clear are promising for future actions, but the overall setup significantly deviates from the required goal configuration. Therefore, significant reorganization of blocks is needed, indicating that the current state is not effectively on the path toward the goal state.
