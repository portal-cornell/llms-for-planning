ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is on top of block D, and block A is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of it. Block C is being held by the robot hand. Block D, along with block B, are both on the table. Additionally, block B is clear. This setup forms the current state of the environment, which includes the positions and statuses of all blocks and the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to rearrange the blocks to achieve a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration requires careful planning to ensure each block is placed correctly while adhering to the rules of the environment where only clear blocks can be moved or have another block placed on top of them.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state describes an impossible configuration where block D is both underneath block C and underneath block A simultaneously. In the current state, block A is on top of block D, and block C is held by the robot hand. Given the physical rules of the Blocksworld, where a block cannot be simultaneously under two different blocks, it is impossible to achieve the described goal state from the current state or any other configuration.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block c is on top of block b.
- Both blocks c and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- Blocks b and d are on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block a.

This setup forms the basis for any actions that might be planned, such as moving blocks to achieve a specific configuration or rearranging them on the table.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to rearrange the blocks to achieve a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration requires careful planning to ensure each block is placed correctly while adhering to the rules of the environment where only clear blocks can be moved or have another block placed on top of them.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state describes an impossible configuration because it demands block A to be on top of block B and block D to be simultaneously on top of block A, which is a circular dependency that cannot exist in the Blocksworld or any physical environment where each block can only occupy one position at a time. The current state, regardless of its arrangement, cannot lead to the goal state as described due to this inherent contradiction in the goal's setup.
