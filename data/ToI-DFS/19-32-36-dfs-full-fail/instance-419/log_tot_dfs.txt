ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects identified as blocks named A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks and the robot's hand is as follows:

1. Block A is positioned on top of Block D.
2. The robot hand is holding Block C.
3. Block A is clear, meaning there is no block on top of A.
4. Block D is on the table.
5. Block B is also on the table.
6. Block B is clear, indicating there is no block on top of B.

This setup outlines the positions and statuses of each block and the robot hand's current action within the Blocksworld domain.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. The robot hand will be used to manipulate the blocks to achieve this configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state presents block A on top of block D, with block C in the robot's hand, and block B clear on the table. The goal state requires a cyclic arrangement where A is on B, C is on D, and D is on A. This goal configuration is not physically possible in a typical Blocksworld setup because it describes a circular stacking (A on B, D on A, C on D) which is a logical impossibility given the linear nature of stacking in Blocksworld. Thus, based on the current description of the goal, achieving this configuration is not feasible.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Block A is positioned on top of Block D, and Block C is placed on top of Block A. Block D is directly on the table. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it. The robot hand is currently holding Block B.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. The robot hand will be used to manipulate the blocks to achieve this configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block C is on top of Block A, which is on top of Block D, with Block B being held by the robot hand. The goal state requires Block A on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block D, and Block D on top of Block A. The described goal state appears contradictory or impossible, as Block D cannot be both directly on the table and underneath Block A simultaneously. Therefore, either the goal state is incorrectly described or misunderstood, or it is genuinely impossible based on the logical constraints of the Blocksworld scenario.
