ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Blocks A and C are both positioned on the table. Furthermore, both blocks A and C are clear, indicating that there is nothing resting on top of them. Meanwhile, the robot hand is currently holding block B.
Goal State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, the objective is to rearrange the blocks such that block B is placed directly on top of block A, and block C is subsequently stacked on top of block B. This setup involves precise manipulation and coordination by the robot hand to achieve the specified configuration of the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block B, while blocks A and C are clear on the table. The goal is to have block B on block A, and then block C on block B. Since block A is clear and the robot is already holding B, the robot can directly perform the action stack(B, A). After this action, block C, which is already clear, can be picked up and stacked on B to achieve the goal configuration. The current state allows for straightforward actions that directly lead to the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block A is positioned on the table, while Block B is directly on top of Block A. The robot hand is currently holding Block C. Additionally, Block B is clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of it. This setup describes the current arrangement and status of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, the objective is to rearrange the blocks such that block B is placed directly on top of block A, and block C is subsequently stacked on top of block B. This setup involves precise manipulation and coordination by the robot hand to achieve the specified configuration of the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires Block B to be on top of Block A and Block C on top of Block B. The current state already has Block B on top of Block A, and the robot hand is holding Block C, which is clear. The next logical step would simply be for the robot hand to stack Block C on top of Block B, as there are no obstacles preventing this action. The configuration is almost complete, with the robot just needing to perform one more action to reach the goal.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block C is on top of block B, and block B is on top of block A. Block A is directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty, and block C is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it. This setup establishes the starting configuration for the blocks and the state of the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, the objective is to rearrange the blocks such that block B is placed directly on top of block A, and block C is subsequently stacked on top of block B. This setup involves precise manipulation and coordination by the robot hand to achieve the specified configuration of the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block C is already on top of block B, and block B is on top of block A, which is on the table. This configuration matches the goal state where block B should be on top of block A, and block C should be on top of block B. Since the current configuration already matches the description of the goal state, the current state is already the goal state.
