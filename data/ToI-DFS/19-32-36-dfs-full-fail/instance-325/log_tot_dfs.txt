ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, we have four blocks: A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their status:

- Block A is placed on top of Block D.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block B.

This arrangement of blocks and the status of the robot hand describe the initial state of the environment in the Blocksworld scenario.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This arrangement forms a specific configuration involving these four blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The description of the goal state provided is inconsistent or impossible as it suggests a circular dependency where block D should be both under block A and under block C simultaneously, while also supporting block A which is above block B. Given that such a configuration defies the basic rules of physical stacking, it is impossible to achieve this goal from the current state or any other state.

Rating: impossible
