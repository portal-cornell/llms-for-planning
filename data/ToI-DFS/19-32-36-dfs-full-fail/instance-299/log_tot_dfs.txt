ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, block C is placed on block B, and block B is on block D. Block D is directly on the table. Block C is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it. The robot hand is currently holding block A.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has block A being held by the robot hand, block C on block B, and block B on block D. The goal state requires block A on block D, block B on block C, and block D on top of block B. However, there is a discrepancy in the goal description which seems to be circular or contradictory (B on C and D on B cannot coexist). Assuming the goal is to have a tower with A, B, C, and D in some order, the current state with the robot holding A could potentially transition to a state closer to a correct goal configuration by placing A on D. If the goal has been misstated and should be something like A on D, B on C, C on B, and all on the table, then the current state is on a path toward a correct configuration. The robot can put down A on D and subsequently rearrange B and C.

Rating: maybe

ACTIONS PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- put-down(a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the configuration and status of each item:

1. Block C is positioned on top of Block B.
2. Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
3. Blocks A and D are placed directly on the table.
4. Both Blocks A and C have no other blocks on top of them, making them clear.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any block.

This setup provides a clear overview of the positions and statuses of all objects in this scenario, important for planning subsequent moves or changes.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires Block A on top of Block D, Block B on top of Block C, and Block D on top of Block B. This configuration is inconsistent as it demands Block D to be simultaneously below both Block A and Block B. Since such a configuration is impossible given the domain constraints (a block can only be directly below one block at a time), the current state does not provide a feasible path to the specified goal state. The goal state itself is flawed.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block B is placed on top of Block D.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.
- Block A is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.

This setup summarizes the state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires Block A on top of Block D, Block B on top of Block C, and Block D on top of Block B. However, the goal state as described contains a logical inconsistency: Block D is supposed to be both directly under Block B and under Block A at the same time, which is physically impossible in this environment. Given this impossibility, the current state cannot logically be on the path to achieving the described goal state.

Rating: impossible
