ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current setup is as follows:

- Block C is placed on top of Block D.
- Blocks A, B, and D are directly on the table.
- Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup allows for actions to be taken on the clear blocks and for the robot to potentially pick up any block that is not underneath another block.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks in such a way that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This arrangement involves coordinating the blocks to achieve the specified stacking order.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the initial attempt at planning the sequence of actions, there is no prior error feedback or state visitation history to reflect upon. The goal is clear, and I must focus on developing a strategy to move from the starting state to the goal state using the valid actions provided.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'a' is on top of block 'd' and block 'c' is on top of block 'a', I need to consider the initial conditions where blocks 'a', 'b', and 'c' are clear, and block 'c' is on top of block 'd'. First, I will need to clear block 'd' by moving block 'c'. Then, I can stack block 'a' onto block 'd'. Finally, I will need to stack block 'c' onto block 'a'. The robot's hand starts empty, so picking up and moving blocks is feasible with the valid actions listed.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
