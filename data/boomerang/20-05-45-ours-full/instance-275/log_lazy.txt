ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: A, B, C, and D. Block B is currently on top of Block D. Both Blocks A and C are positioned on the table. Each of the blocks A, B, and C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block D is also on the table but has Block B above it, so it is not clear. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations such as picking up or moving blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This will create a vertical stack of the blocks in the order A, B, C, D starting from the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is our initial attempt at arranging the blocks, so we need to carefully consider the actions to move from the starting state to the goal state. The goal is to create a vertical stack in the order of A, B, C, D. We should utilize the valid actions to manipulate the blocks in a way that allows us to stack them appropriately.

Think: In the starting state, blocks A and C are clear and can be picked up, and block B can be unstacked from D. The robot's hand is empty, which allows us to pick up or unstack a block directly. The first action should involve making block D clear since it is the base in the goal state. We need to unstack B from D first. After unstacking B, the robot hand will be holding B, and we can then put B down on the table temporarily. Next, we can pick up and stack C onto D since C is clear and on the table. Following this, we can pick up B and stack it onto C. Finally, we can pick up A and stack it on top of B to reach the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
