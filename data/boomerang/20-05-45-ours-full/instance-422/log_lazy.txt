ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The current configuration of blocks and conditions is as follows:

- Block A is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also on the table and clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
- Block C is on top of Block B, and it is clear as there are no blocks on top of C.
- Block D is on the table and clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of D.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it's not holding any blocks.

The environment is set up for the robot to perform actions such as picking up, stacking, or moving the blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to achieve a configuration where block A is on top of block B, and block D is stacked on top of block A. This setting involves manipulating the positions of blocks A, B, and D to achieve the desired stack order using the robot hand's actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the first attempt at proposing an action sequence, so there is no prior error feedback or visited states to reflect upon. The goal is to stack block A on B and then stack block D on A. Given the current state, block C needs to be moved before stacking A on B.

Think: The first step should be to clear block B by moving block C, which is currently on top of B. Once B is clear, block A can be picked up and stacked on B. After stacking A on B, block D, which is already clear and on the table, can be picked up and stacked on A. The sequence must use the valid actions available at each state after each move.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
