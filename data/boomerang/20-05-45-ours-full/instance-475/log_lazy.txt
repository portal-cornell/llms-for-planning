ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the specified environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. These blocks are arranged with blocks E and A directly on the table, and block E is stacked on top of block B. Blocks C and D are also on the table. The blocks A, C, D, and E are clear, which means there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty. This setup allows for various actions such as moving the clear blocks or changing the configuration by stacking or unstacking the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(e:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block E, block C is on top of block D, block D is on block A, and block E is on block C. This specific configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Given the starting configuration and the goal, I need to carefully plan the order of actions to reach the goal state without violating the rules of the blocks being clear for manipulation. The robot hand being empty initially allows for a variety of actions to be taken directly.

Think: 
The goal configuration requires a specific order of blocks. First, I need to clear the way by moving block E off of B. Then, I should rearrange blocks D, C, and A to form a stack of C on D, and D on A. Finally, I should stack B on E and E on C, according to the goal state. The robot's ability to only hold one block at a time and the requirement for blocks to be clear to move them must be considered at each step.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(e:default,b:default), put-down(e:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(e:default), stack(e:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,e:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(e:default,b:default)", "put-down(e:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(e:default)", "stack(e:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,e:default)"]

Optimal plan: ["pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "unstack(e:default,b:default)", "stack(e:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,e:default)"]
