ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this scenario, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', which are blocks in a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'd' is directly on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd'.

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first sequence of actions and there's no prior sequence or error feedback, all valid actions are based on the current state description. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to have block 'a' on top of 'b', and 'b' on top of 'c'. Currently, block 'c' is on top of 'a', which is not the desired configuration.

Think: To achieve the goal state:
1. 'c' needs to be moved off 'a' and placed temporarily on the table or stacked on 'd'.
2. Then, 'a' should be moved to stack on 'b'.
3. Finally, 'b' should be stacked on 'c'.
The valid action available is to unstack 'c' from 'a'. After 'c' is unstacked, it can be placed on the table (since the hand will be occupied). Then, 'a' can be unstacked from 'd' and stacked on 'b'. Subsequently, 'b' can be unstacked from the table and stacked on 'c'.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(a:default,b:default)' at index 3 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)
- stack(a:default,d:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the environment, there are four objects, specifically blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block d is directly on top of block b.
- Block a is directly on top of block d, making it the topmost block in this stack.
- Block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup indicates a vertical stack of blocks b, d, and a (from bottom to top) with block c being held by the robot hand, ready to be positioned or stacked.
put-down(c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's a summary of the current configuration and status of each object:

1. Block B is on the table.
2. Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
3. Block C is on the table.
4. Block A is stacked on top of Block D.
5. Both Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
6. The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup reflects the initial positions and statuses of the blocks relative to each other and the table, and the state of the robot hand in the Blocksworld scenario.
unstack(a:default,d:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block b and c are placed directly on the table. The block d is situated on top of the block b. Both blocks c and d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding the block a.

Starting State:
In this scenario, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', which are blocks in a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'd' is directly on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd'.

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action sequence included an error where the action 'stack(a:default,b:default)' was invalid because the state did not allow for stacking block 'a' on block 'b' at that moment. The valid actions available were to either put down block 'a' or stack it on either block 'c' or block 'd'. This indicates a misunderstanding of the correct sequence and state requirements for stacking actions. It's important to ensure that the target block ('b' in this case) is clear and the robot hand is correctly holding the block to be stacked.

Think: The current state has block 'a' in the robot hand, blocks 'b' and 'c' on the table, and 'd' on top of 'b'. To achieve the goal state where 'a' is on 'b' and 'b' is on 'c', the following steps should be considered:
- First, block 'a' should be put down since it cannot be directly stacked on 'b' yet.
- Next, block 'b' should be unstacked from 'd' to make it clear for stacking.
- Once 'b' is clear and on the table, block 'a' can be picked up again and stacked on 'b'.
- Finally, block 'b' (with 'a' on top) can be picked up and stacked on 'c'.

Action Sequence: put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'put-down(a:default)' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)

States Visited:

Starting State:
In this scenario, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', which are blocks in a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'd' is directly on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd'.

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that the initial action 'put-down(a:default)' was invalid because the robot hand was empty at that time, and the action did not align with the available valid actions. The only valid action from the starting state was 'unstack(c:default,a:default)', which was necessary given that block 'c' was clear and on top of block 'a', and the robot hand was empty. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the current state of the environment accurately and choosing actions that directly correspond to the valid options available.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'a' is on top of block 'b' and block 'b' is on top of block 'c', a correct sequence of actions needs to be carefully planned considering the initial positions of the blocks and the robot hand's state. First, I need to unstack block 'c' from block 'a' and put it down. Then, unstack block 'a' from block 'd'. Next, I need to rearrange 'b' and 'd' to make 'b' clear to receive 'a', followed by stacking 'b' on 'c'.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action 'unstack(b:default,d:default)' at index 4 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the environment, there are four objects, specifically blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block d is directly on top of block b.
- Block a is directly on top of block d, making it the topmost block in this stack.
- Block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup indicates a vertical stack of blocks b, d, and a (from bottom to top) with block c being held by the robot hand, ready to be positioned or stacked.
put-down(c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's a summary of the current configuration and status of each object:

1. Block B is on the table.
2. Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
3. Block C is on the table.
4. Block A is stacked on top of Block D.
5. Both Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
6. The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup reflects the initial positions and statuses of the blocks relative to each other and the table, and the state of the robot hand in the Blocksworld scenario.
unstack(a:default,d:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block b and c are placed directly on the table. The block d is situated on top of the block b. Both blocks c and d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding the block a.
put-down(a:default):
In the current environment, the setup consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the summary of the state:

1. Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is also on the table and clear, with nothing on top.
3. Block C is placed on the table and is clear as well.
4. Block D is on top of Block B and is clear.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves blocks being in a specific arrangement where some are stacked while others are directly on the table, and all top surfaces of the blocks are clear. The robot hand is not holding any blocks at this moment.

Starting State:
In this scenario, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', which are blocks in a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'd' is directly on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd'.

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicated that the action 'unstack(b:default,d:default)' was invalid because block 'b' was not on top of block 'd', but rather the other way around. The valid action should have been 'unstack(d:default,b:default)'. This mistake highlights the importance of understanding the current configuration of blocks correctly and ensuring the target and base blocks for unstacking actions are accurately identified.

Think: To reach the goal state where block 'a' is on 'b' and 'b' on 'c', the sequence must start by unstacking 'c' from 'a', placing 'c' down, unstacking 'a' from 'd', and putting 'a' down. Then, 'd' needs to be unstacked from 'b', and 'b' should be clear to pick up. Once 'b' is clear, 'a' can be stacked on 'b', and finally, 'b' can be stacked on 'c'.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

unstack(a:default,d:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block b and c are placed directly on the table. The block d is situated on top of the block b. Both blocks c and d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding the block a.
put-down(a:default):
In the current environment, the setup consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the summary of the state:

1. Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.

3. Block C is placed on the table and is clear as well.
4. Block D is on top of Block B and is clear.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves blocks being in a specific arrangement where some are stacked while others are directly on the table, and all top surfaces of the blocks are clear. The robot hand is not holding any blocks at this moment.
unstack(d:default,b:default):
In the current state of the environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and C are all positioned on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently holding block D.
put-down(d:default):
In this scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All these blocks are placed directly on the table. Each of these blocks (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations like picking up or stacking blocks as needed.
pick-up(a:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks B, C, and D are positioned on the table and each of these blocks is clear with no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block A. This setup is part of a scenario where the robot's goal is to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration by manipulating them using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
stack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. The current configuration of the blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

1. Block A is on top of Block B, and Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block B is located on the table.
3. Block C is also on the table and is clear.
4. Block D is on the table as well and is clear.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with some on the table and one (Block A) stacked on another (Block B), and the robot hand is not currently holding any blocks.

Starting State:
In this scenario, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', which are blocks in a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'd' is directly on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd'.

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback pointed out that the action 'pick-up(b:default)' at index 8 was invalid because block 'b' was not clear at that moment; block 'a' was on top of it. The valid actions available were to pick up either block 'c' or 'd', or to unstack 'a' from 'b'. This mistake emphasizes the need to ensure that a block is clear (with nothing on top of it) before attempting to pick it up or unstack something from it.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c', I need to ensure each action correctly transitions the blocks from their current state to the desired arrangement. Given the latest state where 'a' is on 'b', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are clear on the table, and the robot hand is empty, the actions should focus on stacking 'b' on 'c' and ensuring the transitions maintain clear states for necessary moves.

Action Sequence: pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback again highlighted an invalid action attempt to 'pick-up(b:default)' when block 'b' was not clear as block 'a' was on top of it. The valid action from the starting state was only 'unstack(c:default,a:default)', indicating that block 'c' needs to be moved first. This repeated error underscores the importance of closely adhering to the configuration of blocks and the sequential rules of valid actions based on the present state.

Think: To reach the goal state where block 'a' is on block 'b', and block 'b' is on 'c', the sequence must ensure each step is valid in terms of block positions and robot hand status. First, 'c' must be unstacked and put down, followed by 'a', then 'd'. The final sequence will involve rearranging 'a', 'b', and 'c' properly.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

This setup is part of a scenario where the robot's goal is to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration by manipulating them using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
stack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. The current configuration of the blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

1. Block A is on top of Block B, and Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block B is located on the table.
3. Block C is also on the table and is clear.
4. Block D is on the table as well and is clear.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with some on the table and one (Block A) stacked on another (Block B), and the robot hand is not currently holding any blocks.

Starting State:
In this scenario, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', which are blocks in a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'd' is directly on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd'.

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The repeated feedback reveals that the action 'pick-up(b:default)' was invalid because block 'b' was not clear at that time, and block 'a' was already stacked on it, making it unavailable for pick-up. The valid actions suggested were either to pick up block 'c' or 'd', or to unstack 'a' from 'b'. This indicates a need for careful attention to the configuration and state of the blocks before determining the next valid action.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback underscores a recurring issue where the action 'unstack(a:default,b:default)' was attempted when it was invalid due to the current state configuration. The only valid action from the starting state was 'unstack(c:default,a:default)', as block 'c' was clear and on top of block 'a'. This points to a need for strict adherence to the valid actions available based on the specific state of the blocks.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(b:default)' at index 8 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the environment, there are four objects, specifically blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block d is directly on top of block b.
- Block a is directly on top of block d, making it the topmost block in this stack.
- Block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup indicates a vertical stack of blocks b, d, and a (from bottom to top) with block c being held by the robot hand, ready to be positioned or stacked.
put-down(c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's a summary of the current configuration and status of each object:

1. Block B is on the table.
2. Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
3. Block C is on the table.
4. Block A is stacked on top of Block D.
5. Both Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
6. The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup reflects the initial positions and statuses of the blocks relative to each other and the table, and the state of the robot hand in the Blocksworld scenario.
unstack(a:default,d:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block b and c are placed directly on the table. The block d is situated on top of the block b. Both blocks c and d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding the block a.
put-down(a:default):
In the current environment, the setup consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the summary of the state:

1. Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is also on the table and clear, with nothing on top.
3. Block C is placed on the table and is clear as well.
4. Block D is on top of Block B and is clear.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves blocks being in a specific arrangement where some are stacked while others are directly on the table, and all top surfaces of the blocks are clear. The robot hand is not holding any blocks at this moment.
unstack(d:default,b:default):
In the current state of the environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and C are all positioned on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently holding block D.
put-down(d:default):
In this scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All these blocks are placed directly on the table. Each of these blocks (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations like picking up or stacking blocks as needed.
pick-up(a:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks B, C, and D are positioned on the table and each of these blocks is clear with no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block A. This setup is part of a scenario where the robot's goal is to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration by manipulating them using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
stack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. The current configuration of the blocks and the status of the robot hand are as follows:

1. Block A is on top of Block B, and Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block B is located on the table.
3. Block C is also on the table and is clear.
4. Block D is on the table as well and is clear.
5. The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates that the blocks are arranged with some on the table and one (Block A) stacked on another (Block B), and the robot hand is not currently holding any blocks.

Starting State:
In this scenario, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', which are blocks in a Blocksworld environment. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.
- Block 'd' is directly on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' is directly on top of block 'd'.

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The repeated error feedback indicates a misunderstanding regarding the state required for picking up block 'b'. When trying to pick up block 'b', it must be clear, meaning no other block should be on top of it. Previously, block 'a' was placed on top of block 'b', preventing block 'b' from being picked up. This oversight underscores the importance of ensuring blocks are clear before attempting to manipulate them.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback continues to indicate the same misunderstanding of the current block configuration and permissible actions. It notes that the action 'unstack(a:default,b:default)' was invalid because block 'a' is not directly on top of block 'b' but rather on 'd', and block 'b' is under 'd'. The only valid action from the starting state was 'unstack(c:default,a:default)'. This situation emphasizes the necessity of recognizing the accurate configuration from the state descriptions and acting accordingly.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

This configuration suggests a vertical arrangement where block 'd' supports 'a', which in turn supports 'c', while block 'b' is positioned separately on the table and is the base for block 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback once again highlights that the action 'pick-up(b:default)' was invalid due to block 'b' not being clear, as it was under block 'a'. This persistent error indicates a misunderstanding of the conditions that must be met for a 'pick-up' action to be valid. In this case, the block to be picked up must be clear of any other blocks on top of it. The sequence needs to ensure that 'b' is clear before attempting to move it.

Corrected Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default)

Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment involves arranging blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action sequence did not meet the goal because block 'b' was not stacked on top of block 'c' as required. The final sequence ended with block 'c' on top of 'd', and 'a' on top of 'b', which does not align with the goal state. The feedback points out that the arrangement missed having 'b' on top of 'c'. This emphasizes the need to revisit the action sequence to ensure that the stacking order corresponds precisely with the goal state requirements.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)
