ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot's state are as follows:

- Block d is on the table.
- Block b is also on the table.
- Block a is stacked on top of block d and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of a.
- Block c is stacked on top of block b and is clear as well.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup is part of a Blocksworld scenario where the robot interacts with these blocks, performing actions to rearrange them according to specific goals using the operations of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks so that block A is placed on top of block D and block C is placed on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the first sequence of actions, there are no previous sequences to reflect upon. I will focus on determining a valid sequence of actions from the starting state to the goal state given the valid actions available.

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block A, which is on top of block D. From the starting state:
- Block A is already on block D, which aligns with part of the goal configuration.
- Block C needs to be moved from its current position (on block B) to on top of block A.
- Since the robot's hand is empty, the first step should be to unstack block C from block B. 
- After unstacking block C, the robot will be holding block C, and can then proceed to stack it on block A.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
