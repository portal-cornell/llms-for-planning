ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are five objects labeled as block A, block B, block C, block D, and block E. Hereâ€™s the current configuration:

- Block A is placed directly on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block B.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block C.
- Block E is stacked on top of Block D, and it is clear, meaning there is nothing placed on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a vertical stack from Block A at the base on the table, ascending to Block E at the top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(e:default,d:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C, creating a specific configuration from the initial setup.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
As this is the first sequence of actions, there is no previous error feedback to reflect upon. The task is to rearrange the blocks from a straight vertical stack to a configuration where block C is on top of block B, block D is on top of block E, and block E is on top of block C.

Think:
To achieve the goal state from the starting state, steps must be taken to unstack the blocks and then restack them in the desired order. Since the robot's hand is empty, the first action will involve unstacking the topmost clear block, which is Block E from Block D. Following this, Block E should be placed on the table temporarily to clear the way to rearrange other blocks. After rearranging blocks C, B, and D, E can be stacked in the desired configuration.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(e:default,d:default), put-down(e:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(e:default), stack(e:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,e:default)
