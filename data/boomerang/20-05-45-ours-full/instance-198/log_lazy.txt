ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot's hand are as follows:

- Block A is on top of Block B and Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- Block D is also on the table and is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment. This setup involves interactions between the blocks and their positions relative to each other and the table, crucial for determining possible moves using the robot's actions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires the blocks to be precisely stacked in the sequence C, B, D from bottom to top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first action sequence proposal, there is no error feedback or previous sequences to reflect upon. The starting state shows that block A is on top of Block B, which is on top of C, and block D is clear on the table. The goal is to have B on C, and D on B. This indicates that block A needs to be moved first to access B.

Think:
To achieve the goal, the robot must rearrange the blocks in the order C, B, D. Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. Unstack block A from B to clear B for the subsequent stacking of D.
2. Put down block A anywhere on the table since its final position is not specified in the goal.
3. As block D is already clear and on the table, it can be picked up.
4. Stack block D on top of block B to meet the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
