ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and each block is in a specific configuration. Block B is on the table, and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Similarly, Block D is also on the table, but Block A is stacked on top of Block D, and Block C is stacked on top of Block A. Both Blocks A and C are clear, indicating that no other blocks are stacked on them. The robot's hand is currently empty, which means it is not holding any blocks at the moment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the described environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block C, block B is stacked on block A, and block C is on top of block D. This configuration must be achieved using the available operations of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks, while considering the constraints of the robot hand's ability to hold only one block at a time and the clear status of each block.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the first attempt at creating an action sequence, there's no feedback or previous sequences to reflect upon. The main consideration in this scenario is to ensure that each action is valid given the state of the blocks and the capabilities of the robot's hand.

Think: The goal is to reconfigure the blocks with specific placements: A on C, B on A, and C on D. Starting with the current configuration, Block C is on A, and A is on D. To achieve the goal state, we need to first make block C accessible to move onto D, then position A and B accordingly.

1. Unstack block C from A (since C is clear and on top of A).
2. Put down block C on the table (to clear the robot's hand).
3. Unstack block A from D (now that A is accessible).
4. Put down block A on the table (to clear the robot's hand).
5. Pick up block C (to move it on top of D).
6. Stack block C on D (as per the goal state).
7. Pick up block A (to be stacked on block C).
8. Stack block A on C (as per the goal state).
9. Pick up block B (since it's clear and on the table).
10. Stack block B on A (to achieve the final goal state configuration).

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(a:default,d:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 11
Total edges expanded: 10
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "unstack(a:default,d:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
