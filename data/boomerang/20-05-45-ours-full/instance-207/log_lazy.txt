ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block C, and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.

The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment involves arranging a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block C, block C should be on top of block D, and block D should be on top of block A. This stacked arrangement will achieve the desired configuration of blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the initial sequence of actions, and no previous actions or errors have been provided, there is nothing specific to reflect upon from prior attempts. However, understanding the proper use of actions like pick-up, put-down, stack, and unstack is essential in planning to avoid invalid actions and inefficiencies.

Think: To achieve the goal state from the starting state, a clear sequence of actions must be considered that rearranges the blocks in the desired order. The goal is to have B on C, C on D, and D on A. The current configuration is A-B-C-D with the robot hand empty. The robot hand can perform unstack and pick-up actions when it's empty and can perform stack and put-down actions when holding a block. The plan should minimize unnecessary moves and ensure the robot hand is not left in an invalid state.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
