ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Specifically, blocks A, B, and C are positioned directly on the table. Block D is stacked on top of block A. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as moving blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block A and block D is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first sequence of actions I'm proposing in this environment, I need to carefully consider the starting state and the valid actions. The goal state requires block B to be stacked on block A and block D on block C. Block D is already on top of A, so it needs to be moved for B to be placed on A. The robot's hand is empty, which means I can use actions like pick-up or unstack to manipulate the blocks.

Think: My strategy will start by clearing block D from block A using the unstack action since this is a valid action and D needs to be repositioned. Once D is in the robot's hand, I can put it down temporarily to free up block A. Then, I can pick up block B (since it's also a clear block) and stack it on block A. Finally, I would pick up block D again and stack it on block C, completing the goal state configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
