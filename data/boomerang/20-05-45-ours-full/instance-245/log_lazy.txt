ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is on the table, and block D is stacked on top of block A. Block B is stacked on top of block C, which is also on the table. The blocks D and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to have block B on top of block A and block D on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first attempt, there are no previous errors to reflect on, and the task is to find an action sequence based on the current configuration of blocks and the goal state.

Think: In the starting state, blocks A and C are on the table, with D stacked on A and B on C. The goal is to have B on A and D on C. To achieve this, the robot hand will need to rearrange the blocks. The valid actions allow us to unstack B from C and D from A. 
1. First, unstack D from A.
2. Put D down on the table.
3. Unstack B from C.
4. Stack B on A.
5. Pick up D from the table.
6. Stack D on C.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(d:default,a:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
