ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d, and a table. Each of the blocks (a, b, c, and d) is positioned directly on the table. Additionally, the top surfaces of all these blocks (a, b, c, and d) are clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on them. The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal for the agent in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D, forming a vertical stack from top to bottom in the order of A, B, C, D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the first instance of planning in this environment, so there isn't any prior error feedback to reflect on. The rules of the environment involve picking up blocks, putting them down, and stacking them with the robot hand, while ensuring the robot hand is not already holding another block.

Think: The goal is to arrange the blocks in a vertical stack with block A on top of B, block B on top of C, and block C on top of D. Initially, all blocks are on the table and clear. The robot hand is empty. To achieve the goal from the starting state:
1. Pick up block D (since it needs to be at the bottom of the stack).
2. Put down block D (to ensure itâ€™s in the correct position, although this action seems redundant as D is already on the table, but it's necessary to follow the procedure).
3. Pick up block C and stack it on D.
4. Pick up block B and stack it on C.
5. Finally, pick up block A and stack it on B.

Action Sequence: pick-up(d:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 8
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
