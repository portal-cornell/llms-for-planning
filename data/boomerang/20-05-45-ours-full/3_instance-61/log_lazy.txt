ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block A is located on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear. Block B is placed on top of Block C. Block C is also on the table, but it is not clear since Block B is on top of it. The robot's hand is currently empty. This setup allows for various actions to be taken to rearrange the blocks according to specific goals, such as moving blocks or stacking them differently.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the ultimate objective is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is positioned directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This configuration should satisfy the goal conditions of the environment.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given that this is the first attempt with no prior errors, we must plan carefully based on the initial and goal states described. The goal is to have 'C' on 'A' on 'B'.

Think: The starting state has block 'A' clear on the table, and 'B' on 'C'. To achieve the goal state, we need to rearrange the blocks. We must first clear 'B' by unstacking it from 'C'. Then, we can move 'A' on top of 'B'. Finally, we need to stack 'C' on top of 'A'.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
