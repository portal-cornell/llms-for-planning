ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current setup of these blocks is as follows:

- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Blocks A, B, and C are directly on the table.
- Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

These conditions summarize the initial state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The robot hand has the capability to manipulate the blocks by either holding them or leaving them empty. The blocks can be placed either on top of each other or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it.

The ultimate objective in this scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'c' is on top of block 'b', and block 'd' is on top of block 'a'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
No error feedback was provided, and this is the first sequence of actions being planned. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that C is on top of B, and D is on top of A. The initial state allows us to pick up blocks A, B, or unstack D from C. The robot's hand is empty, which is essential for picking up or unstacking blocks.

Think:
The goal requires stacking C on B and D on A. To achieve this, we need to ensure both B and A are clear and ready to have another block stacked upon them. Initially, A and B are clear and on the table. Block D, which is clear, is on top of C, so it can be unstacked first. After unstacking D, C becomes clear.

1. Unstack D from C (making both D and C clear).
2. Put down D anywhere on the table (since D ultimately needs to be placed on A).
3. Pick up C to prepare it for stacking on B.
4. Stack C on B.
5. Pick up D.
6. Stack D on A.

This sequence should set up the blocks in the desired configuration as per the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
