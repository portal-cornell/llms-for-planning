States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these elements:

- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Block B is directly on top of Block D.
- Block A is directly on top of Block B.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- The topmost block, Block A, is clear, meaning there is nothing on it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This summary provides an overview of the arrangement and status of all blocks and the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a precise order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the first set of instructions and no previous actions have been taken, there is nothing specific to reflect on from prior steps. We need to focus on understanding the current state of the blocks and the goal state to determine the necessary actions.

Think: The current state has Block A on top of Block B, which is on top of Block D, and then on Block C, which is on the table. The goal is for Block A to be on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block A, and Block D on top of Block C. To achieve the goal:
1. Unstack A from B to clear B and make A available.
2. Unstack B from D to clear D and rearrange B.
3. Unstack D from C to clear C for rearrangement.
4. Stack B on A as per the goal state.
5. Stack C on A after A is placed on B.
6. Stack D on C to complete the desired configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), stack(b:default,a:default), stack(c:default,a:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'unstack(b:default,d:default)' at index 1 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)

States Visited:
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block B is placed on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. Block C is directly on the table. The robot hand is holding block A. Additionally, block B is clear, meaning there is no block on top of B. This setup outlines the current configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these elements:

- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Block B is directly on top of Block D.
- Block A is directly on top of Block B.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- The topmost block, Block A, is clear, meaning there is nothing on it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This summary provides an overview of the arrangement and status of all blocks and the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a precise order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the action 'unstack(b:default,d:default)' was invalid because the robot hand was holding block A, hence it couldn't unstack B from D. The valid actions at that state were either to put down block A or stack it back on block B. This highlights the constraint that the robot can perform actions only when its hand is empty or needs to place the block it is holding before performing other unstack actions.

Think: Given that block A has been unstacked from B, and I initially attempted to unstack B from D while holding A, the next logical step would be to put down A, which will free the robot's hand. Then, unstack B from D, followed by D from C, and reorganize them to match the goal state configuration. I need to ensure that the robot's hand is free before attempting to unstack another block.

Action Sequence: put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), stack(b:default,a:default), stack(c:default,b:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback pointed out that the proposed action 'put-down(a:default)' was invalid, as the robot's hand was empty at the start, contradicting my previous assumption. This indicates that I misinterpreted the robot's state in the starting condition. The robot can only unstack block A from block B as its initial valid action.

Think: Since the robot's hand is empty, the only immediate action is to unstack block A from block B. After that, the robot will be holding block A, and then I can continue with adjusting the positions of the other blocks to reach the goal state configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' at index 11 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)

States Visited:
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block B is placed on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. Block C is directly on the table. The robot hand is holding block A. Additionally, block B is clear, meaning there is no block on top of B. This setup outlines the current configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.
put-down(a:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot hand:

1. Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block b is on top of block d and is also clear.
3. Block c is on the table but has block d on top of it, so it is not clear.
4. Block d is directly on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is empty.

This setup forms a vertical stack with blocks c and d, while blocks a and b are individually placed and clear. The objective in this environment typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks, guided by the robot's hand being initially empty.
unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current scenario, the robot hand is holding block B. Block A is sitting on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear. Block D is positioned on top of block C, and block D is clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it. Block C is also on the table. The objects present in this environment are blocks A, B, C, and D.
put-down(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration of these blocks and their status:

- Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also on the table and clear.
- Block C is on the table and clear.
- Block D is placed on top of Block C, and Block D itself is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setup indicates that all blocks are accessible and that the robot can perform actions such as picking up any of the clear blocks or moving Block D.
unstack(d:default,c:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current state of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is also on the table and is clear.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d. 

Each block is positioned independently on the table, and none are stacked on top of another. The robot hand's task may involve placing or stacking these blocks as needed to achieve a desired configuration.
put-down(d:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup allows for various actions like picking up any block since they are all accessible and the hand is free to operate.
pick-up(a:default):
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, blocks b, c, and d are placed on the table and are clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is holding block a.
stack(a:default,c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is positioned on block C, and both block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block B and block D are placed directly on the table and are also clear. The robot's hand is empty at this moment. This setup forms the initial state or current configuration of the blocks in the environment.
pick-up(b:default):
In the current scenario, the environment includes four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Block D is on the table and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block C is also on the table. Block A is positioned on top of block C and is clear, indicating that no other blocks are placed on top of block A.
stack(b:default,a:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block B is on top of block A and block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block A is on top of block C. Block D is on the table and is clear. The robot's hand is empty. This setup indicates that blocks are stacked with B on A and A on C, while D is separately on the table without any blocks on it.
pick-up(d:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here’s a summary of their arrangement and status:

1. Block B is placed on top of Block A.
2. Block A is positioned on top of Block C.
3. Block C is directly on the table.
4. The robot hand is currently holding Block D.
5. Block B is clear, meaning no block is placed on top of it.

This setup indicates a vertical stack involving Blocks A, B, and C, with Block D being manipulated by the robot hand. Block B’s top is free for potential placement of another block if needed.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these elements:

- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Block B is directly on top of Block D.
- Block A is directly on top of Block B.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- The topmost block, Block A, is clear, meaning there is nothing on it.

This summary provides an overview of the arrangement and status of all blocks and the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a precise order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that the action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' was invalid because at that state, block D could only be stacked on block B or put down, not on block C. This indicates a misunderstanding in the arrangement and the allowable moves at that state. I need to better track the changes in block clear status and adhere strictly to the valid actions provided after each move.

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C, I need to ensure that each block is clear before attempting to stack another block on it. After reviewing the states visited and reflecting on the valid actions, I will devise a new sequence that adheres to these rules.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

2. Block b is on top of block d and is also clear.
3. Block c is on the table but has block d on top of it, so it is not clear.
4. Block d is directly on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is empty.

This setup forms a vertical stack with blocks c and d, while blocks a and b are individually placed and clear. The objective in this environment typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks, guided by the robot's hand being initially empty.

- Block B is also on the table and clear.
- Block C is on the table and clear.
- Block D is placed on top of Block C, and Block D itself is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setup indicates that all blocks are accessible and that the robot can perform actions such as picking up any of the clear blocks or moving Block D.
unstack(d:default,c:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current state of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is also on the table and is clear.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d. 

Each block is positioned independently on the table, and none are stacked on top of another. The robot hand's task may involve placing or stacking these blocks as needed to achieve a desired configuration.
put-down(d:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.

pick-up(b:default):
In the described environment, the current configuration includes four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is holding block B. Block A is positioned on the table. Block C is on top of block A and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block C. Block D is also on the table and is clear. This setup indicates that the blocks are spread between being stacked and being directly on the table, with the robot actively engaged in manipulating one of the blocks.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these elements:

- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Block B is directly on top of Block D.

- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- The topmost block, Block A, is clear, meaning there is nothing on it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This summary provides an overview of the arrangement and status of all blocks and the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a precise order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the action 'stack(b:default,a:default)' was invalid because block A was under block C, and thus not available for block B to be stacked upon. At that state, the valid actions for block B were to stack it on block C or D, or put it down. This highlights the importance of considering the clear status of each block before attempting to stack them.

Think: Based on the valid actions and the ultimate goal of having A on B, C on A, and D on C, I must carefully sequence the stacking and unstacking to ensure each block is clear before attempting to move it. The goal requires careful planning of the sequence to avoid retracing steps and invalid actions.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)

- Block B is also on the table and has block C on top of it.
- Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
- Block D is clear and placed on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. This setup suggests that the robot can manipulate blocks A, C, and D directly since they are clear, whereas block B is underneath C and requires repositioning of C to be manipulated.
pick-up(a:default):
In this Blocks World environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block B and block D are on the table. Block C is positioned on top of block B. Both block C and block D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on them. The robot hand is holding block A.

4. Block C is directly on top of Block B.
5. Block A is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of it.
6. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup involves a stack with Block C at the base, supporting Block A, while Blocks B and D are independently positioned on the table.
pick-up(d:default):
In the described environment, we have four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Currently, block d is being held by the robot hand. Block b is on the table, and block a is stacked on top of block c, which in turn is on top of block b. Additionally, block a is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
stack(d:default,a:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration of these blocks is such that block d is on block a, block a is on block c, and block c is on block b. Block b is placed directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, and block d is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these elements:

- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Block B is directly on top of Block D.
- Block A is directly on top of Block B.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- The topmost block, Block A, is clear, meaning there is nothing on it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This summary provides an overview of the arrangement and status of all blocks and the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a precise order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action sequence did not lead to the goal state configuration, which requires Block A to be on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block A, and Block D on top of Block C. The actions taken in the previous sequence did not correctly arrange the blocks to meet these conditions.

Think: To reach the goal state, the movements of the blocks must be planned such that they are stacked in the correct order, without violating the constraints of block availability and placement. Given the starting state where Block A is on B, B on D, and D on C, a logical step is to clear the blocks off each other and then systematically stack them in the required order.

Action Sequence:
1. unstack(a:default,b:default) - Remove A from B, hold A.
2. put-down(a:default) - Place A on the table, empty hand.
3. unstack(b:default,d:default) - Remove B from D, hold B.
4. put-down(b:default) - Place B on the table, empty hand.
5. unstack(d:default,c:default) - Remove D from C, hold D.
6. put-down(d:default) - Place D on the table, empty hand.
7. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up B.
8. stack(b:default,a:default) - Stack B on A.
9. pick-up(c:default) - Pick up C.
10. stack(c:default,b:default) - Stack C on B.
11. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up D.
12. stack(d:default,c:default) - Stack D on C.

This sequence, if followed correctly, will rearrange the blocks such that A is at the base, B is on A, C is on B, and D is on C, matching the goal state configuration.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the previous action sequence was misunderstood, and the action proposed was already valid but incorrectly formatted with additional text. It's crucial to follow the exact action structure as defined in the environment without additional explanations or modifications to ensure the action is recognized by the system.

Think: Given the starting state and valid actions, I will initiate the sequence by unstacking block A from block B, as it is the only immediate valid action. Then, I'll plan subsequent moves to reach the goal state by rearranging the blocks in the correct order.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action sequence did not reach the goal. Below are the predicates that were not satisfied:
- on(a:default,b:default)
- on(c:default,a:default)

States Visited:
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block B is placed on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C. Block C is directly on the table. The robot hand is holding block A. Additionally, block B is clear, meaning there is no block on top of B. This setup outlines the current configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.
put-down(a:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot hand:

1. Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block b is on top of block d and is also clear.
3. Block c is on the table but has block d on top of it, so it is not clear.
4. Block d is directly on top of block c.
5. The robot's hand is empty.

This setup forms a vertical stack with blocks c and d, while blocks a and b are individually placed and clear. The objective in this environment typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks, guided by the robot's hand being initially empty.
unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current scenario, the robot hand is holding block B. Block A is sitting on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear. Block D is positioned on top of block C, and block D is clear, indicating there is nothing on top of it. Block C is also on the table. The objects present in this environment are blocks A, B, C, and D.
put-down(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration of these blocks and their status:

- Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also on the table and clear.
- Block C is on the table and clear.
- Block D is placed on top of Block C, and Block D itself is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment. This setup indicates that all blocks are accessible and that the robot can perform actions such as picking up any of the clear blocks or moving Block D.
unstack(d:default,c:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current state of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is also on the table and is clear.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d. 

Each block is positioned independently on the table, and none are stacked on top of another. The robot hand's task may involve placing or stacking these blocks as needed to achieve a desired configuration.
put-down(d:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup allows for various actions like picking up any block since they are all accessible and the hand is free to operate.
pick-up(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a summary of their status:

- Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks A, C, and D are all placed on the table.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.

This setup indicates that the robot hand is occupied and could potentially place block B on the table or on top of another clear block. Blocks A, C, and D are available for manipulation, such as stacking or being picked up by the robot hand.
stack(b:default,a:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block C is on the table and is clear.
- Block D is also on the table and is clear.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup is part of a scenario where the objective is to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration using the robot hand.
pick-up(c:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is on the table and block B is stacked on top of block A. Block B is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it. Block D is also on the table and is clear. The robot's hand is holding block C.
stack(c:default,b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The arrangement and conditions of these blocks and the robot's status are as follows:

- Block a is located directly on the table.
- Block b is stacked on top of block a.
- Block c is stacked on top of block b, making it the top block of this three-block stack.
- Block d is independently placed on the table and there is nothing on top of it, which means it is clear.
- Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup provides a clear indication of the spatial arrangement and the immediate possibilities for the robot's actions concerning these blocks.
pick-up(d:default):
In the current scenario, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. The arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is stacked on top of block a.
- Block c is stacked on top of block b and is clear, meaning there is no block on top of block c.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block d.

This setup of blocks and the state of the robot hand must be accurately maintained or considered for planning any further actions in this environment.
stack(d:default,c:default):
In the given Blocksworld environment, the current configuration can be summarized as follows:

- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'b' is stacked on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'c' is stacked on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'd' is stacked on top of block 'c' and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- The robot's hand is empty.

The objects present in this scenario are blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration and state of these elements:

- Block A is directly on top of Block B.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- The topmost block, Block A, is clear, meaning there is nothing on it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This summary provides an overview of the arrangement and status of all blocks and the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires stacking the blocks in a precise order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action sequence did not achieve the goal state, failing to satisfy the conditions that Block A should be on top of Block B, Block C on top of Block A, and Block D on top of Block C. The sequence was flawed in the order of stacking, which did not reflect the desired final configuration.

Think: To achieve the goal state, I need to create a sequence of actions that starts from the initial configuration and rearranges the blocks to match the goal. This includes placing Block A on Block B, then stacking Block C on Block A, and finally stacking Block D on Block C.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(a:default,b:default) - Start by unstacking Block A from Block B.
2. put-down(a:default) - Put down Block A on the table.
3. unstack(b:default,d:default) - Unstack Block B from Block D.
4. put-down(b:default) - Put down Block B on the table.
5. unstack(d:default,c:default) - Unstack Block D from Block C.
6. put-down(d:default) - Put down Block D on the table.
7. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up Block A.
8. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stack Block A on Block B.
9. pick-up(c:default) - Pick up Block C.
10. stack(c:default,a:default) - Stack Block C on Block A.
11. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up Block D.
12. stack(d:default,c:default) - Stack Block D on Block C. 

This sequence specifically addresses the required stacking order to reach the goal configuration, ensuring each block is placed according to the goal state conditions.
