ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here is the current configuration:

- Block A is directly on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block B, making it the topmost block in this stack.
- Block D is also on the table and has nothing on top of it, so it is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup of blocks and conditions allows for certain movements such as picking up Block C or D (since they are clear), or manipulating other blocks to achieve a new configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block A, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This creates a configuration involving these blocks where they must be stacked in a particular order to achieve the desired state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given that the robot's hand is currently empty and the accessible blocks are C and D, it is important to first make accessible those blocks which need to be repositioned to achieve the goal state. The goal state requires a specific stacking order which is not currently present.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the first task would be to clear the blocks that are not in their final position. Since block C needs to eventually be on top of block D, and D needs to be on top of B, careful unstacking and stacking must be planned. The robot should start by freeing up block D while also preparing to reposition block C.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default)
