ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's a description of their arrangement and status:

1. Block B is placed directly on the table.
2. Block C is also directly on the table.
3. Block D is positioned on top of Block B.
4. Block A is stacked on Block C.
5. Both Block A and Block D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
6. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that Blocks B and C serve as bases for Blocks D and A, respectively, while ensuring that the robot can manipulate the clear blocks or potentially move any block to achieve a desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal for the agent is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'd' is on top of block 'b'. This configuration must be achieved through a sequence of actions involving picking up, stacking, unstacking, and putting down the blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first attempt to create an action sequence in this scenario, there is no prior feedback or error to reflect upon. The primary focus is on understanding the environment and the goal state, then planning an efficient sequence of actions to rearrange the blocks accordingly.

Think: The goal is to have block A on top of block D, and block D on top of block B. The starting state has block D on top of block B, which is part of the goal state. Block A is on top of block C and needs to be moved to block D. 

1. Since the robot hand is empty and block A is clear, the first action should be to unstack block A from block C.
2. After unstacking block A, the robot will be holding block A, and the next logical step is to stack block A on top of block D, which is already on block B.
3. These actions should lead to the desired goal state configuration without needing additional moves because block D is already correctly placed on block B.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,c:default), stack(a:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
