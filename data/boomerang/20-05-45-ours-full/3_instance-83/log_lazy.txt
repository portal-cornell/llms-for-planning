ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Block 'b' is positioned on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear. Similarly, block 'c' is also on the table. Block 'a' is positioned on top of block 'c', and block 'a' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The robot hand is currently empty and ready to manipulate any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C and block B is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial set of instructions, there is no prior feedback or actions to reflect upon. The current state has block 'a' on top of block 'c', which partially matches the goal except that block 'b' needs to be stacked on top of block 'a'.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'b' is on top of block 'a', which is on top of block 'c', we need to ensure that block 'b' is clear to pick up and stack. Currently, block 'b' is clear and on the table, so we can pick it up directly. Block 'a' is already in the correct position on top of block 'c'. The actions required would involve picking up block 'b', and then stacking it on block 'a'.
