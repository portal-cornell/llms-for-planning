ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot's hand:

1. Block D is placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first attempt at proposing an action sequence, there is no prior feedback to reflect on. However, it's important to understand the current configuration of the blocks and the desired goal state to devise an effective sequence.

Think: The current configuration is D on the table, followed by B, C, A on top of each other in a stack. The goal is to have A on B, B on C, and C on D. To achieve this:
1. First, unstack A from the stack of B->C->A.
2. Next, D, being clear, should be stacked under C, but C is currently under A and needs to be cleared.
3. Unstack C from B.
4. Stack C on D, which is already on the table.
5. Finally, stack A on B.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), stack(c:default,d:default), stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action 'unstack(a:default,b:default)' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)

2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that the first proposed action "unstack(a:default,b:default)" was invalid because A was not directly on B; instead, A was on C. The only valid unstack action available was "unstack(d:default,a:default)" because D was the clear block on top of the stack. This misunderstanding of the block configuration led to the proposal of an invalid action.

Think: To reach the goal state, where A is on B, B is on C, and C is on D, we need to rearrange the blocks according to their availability to move, which starts with the topmost clear block. We'll begin by using the valid action to unstack D from A. Following that, we need to put down D, unstack A from C, put down A, and then proceed to restack them in the desired order.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(c:default)' at index 4 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)

States Visited:
unstack(d:default,a:default):
In the current scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a robot hand. The current state of these objects is described as follows:

1. The robot hand is holding block d.
2. Block b is placed directly on the table.
3. Block a is positioned on top of block c.
4. Block c is stacked on top of block b.
5. Block a is clear, meaning there is no block on top of block a.

This setup forms a tower with block b at the base, block c above b, and block a at the top. Block d is being held by the robot hand and is not part of the tower.
put-down(d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and their relationship to other elements in the environment are as follows:

1. Block b is placed directly on the table.
2. Block d is also on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is placed on top of it.
3. Block c is stacked on top of block b.
4. Block a is stacked on top of block c and is clear, indicating that there is no block on top of block a.
5. The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to one another and the table, along with the status of the robot's hand.
unstack(a:default,c:default):
In the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and their status is as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block c is on top of block b and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
- Block d is on the table and is also clear.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block a.

This setup indicates that blocks b and d are directly on the table, c is stacked on b, and a is not on the table but in the robot's hand. All blocks except b are clear, which means they can be interacted with or moved by the robot without needing to move other blocks first.
put-down(a:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot's hand is as follows:

- Block A is clear (meaning nothing is on top of it) and it is placed on the table.
- Block B is also on the table and has Block C on top of it, making Block C not clear.
- Block C, while on top of Block B, is clear.
- Block D is clear and on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the starting point or the current state in the environment, which is crucial for planning the next steps or actions to achieve a desired goal configuration of blocks.

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot's hand:

1. Block D is placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicated that the action 'pick-up(c:default)' was invalid because block C was not clear to be picked up directly from its position on top of block B. The valid actions available were 'pick-up(a:default)', 'pick-up(d:default)', and 'unstack(c:default,b:default)'. This suggests that a block must be clear (i.e., nothing on top of it) for it to be picked up or unstacked. Therefore, the sequence needs to respect the rule that only clear blocks can be manipulated directly.

Think: Since the robot's hand is empty after putting down block A, and the configuration allows for unstacking block C from block B or picking up block D, the next steps should focus on rearranging the blocks to achieve the goal state without violating the rules about block clarity and movement constraints.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback again highlights the misuse of the unstack operation. The action 'unstack(c:default,b:default)' was invalid because block C was not the clear block on top of the pile. The only valid action is to unstack block D from A, meaning D is the clear block and the only one that can be directly manipulated by the robot's hand. It's important to follow the rules that only the topmost clear block in a stack can be unstacked or manipulated.

Think: To move towards the goal state, I need to unstack block D from A and reorganize the blocks with valid actions. The goal is to stack A on B, B on C, and C on D. I must carefully consider the configuration after each action to ensure that the actions keep the blocks in a manageable state and are valid according to the current configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)

In the current scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a robot hand. The current state of these objects is described as follows:

1. The robot hand is holding block d.
2. Block b is placed directly on the table.
3. Block a is positioned on top of block c.
4. Block c is stacked on top of block b.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The feedback indicates that the action 'pick-up(a:default)' was invalid because block A was not free to pick up directly from its position on top of block C since the robot's hand was not empty. The valid actions available were 'pick-up(d:default)' and 'unstack(a:default,c:default)'. This underlines the importance of ensuring the robot's hand is empty before attempting to pick up a block and that the block being picked up or unstacked must be clear.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)

In the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and their status is as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block c is on top of block b and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
- Block d is on the table and is also clear.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block a.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback pointed out that the action 'pick-up(b:default)' was invalid because block B, being at the base of the stack with block C on top, was not clear and thus not pickable. The valid actions were 'pick-up(a:default)', 'pick-up(d:default)', and 'unstack(c:default,b:default)'. This indicates the importance of ensuring a block is clear (no other blocks on top of it) before attempting to pick it up or unstack it.

1. Block b is placed directly on the table.
2. Block d is also on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is placed on top of it.
3. Block c is stacked on top of block b.
4. Block a is stacked on top of block c and is clear, indicating that there is no block on top of block a.
5. The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to one another and the table, along with the status of the robot's hand.
unstack(a:default,c:default):
In the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and their status is as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block c is on top of block b and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
- Block d is on the table and is also clear.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block a.

This setup indicates that blocks b and d are directly on the table, c is stacked on b, and a is not on the table but in the robot's hand. All blocks except b are clear, which means they can be interacted with or moved by the robot without needing to move other blocks first.
put-down(a:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot's hand is as follows:

- Block B is also on the table and has Block C on top of it, making Block C not clear.
- Block C, while on top of Block B, is clear.
- Block D is clear and on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the starting point or the current state in the environment, which is crucial for planning the next steps or actions to achieve a desired goal configuration of blocks.
unstack(c:default,b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table. Both blocks B and D, as well as block A, are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently holding block C.
put-down(c:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Presently:

- Blocks A, B, C, and D are all placed on the table.
- All these blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning no other block is stacked on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to pick up or manipulate the blocks as needed. 

This setup allows for any block to be picked up or moved without rearranging others first.
pick-up(d:default):
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. The current state of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is also on the table and clear.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.

This setup involves blocks solely positioned on the table, each clear and accessible for manipulation. Block d is the exception as it is in the grasp of the robot hand, indicating potential for an action like putting it down on the table or stacking it on another block.
stack(d:default,b:default):
In this Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is clear and located on the table.
- Block B is also on the table and has Block D placed on top of it.
- Block C is clear and on the table.
- Block D is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup means that Blocks B, C, and D are accessible for manipulation by the robot, either to be picked up or to have another block stacked on top of them, while Block A is ready to have another block placed on it or be moved by the robot.
pick-up(c:default):
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows: Block A and Block B are both placed on the table. Block D is stacked on top of Block B. Blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.
stack(c:default,d:default):
The environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the blocks are arranged as follows:
- Block A and Block B are directly on the table.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.

In terms of accessibility:
- Block C and Block A are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them.

The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to either pick up any clear blocks or manipulate existing structures by stacking or unstacking to achieve a desired configuration.
pick-up(a:default):
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block c is positioned on block d, and block d is on block b. Block b is directly on the table. Block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot hand is holding block a.
stack(a:default,c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration and status:

1. Block C is on top of Block D.
2. Block B is on the table.
3. Block D is on top of Block B.
4. The robot hand is empty.
5. Block A is on top of Block C.
6. Block A is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.

This setup indicates a vertical stacking of the blocks with A on C, C on D, and D on B, which is placed directly on the table. The goal in this scenario would likely involve rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using the robot hand.

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot's hand:

1. Block D is placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the sequence did not meet the goal because the predicates "on(a:default,b:default)" and "on(b:default,c:default)" were not satisfied. This means that the final configuration did not have block A on block B, and block B on block C, respectively. The sequence needs to be adjusted to achieve the specific stacking order required by the goal state.

Think: The goal is to have A on B, B on C, and C on D. The final steps in the previous sequence resulted in A on C, C on D, and D on B. To correct this, the blocks need to be rearranged after unstacking to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: 
- unstack(d:default,a:default),   // Robot hand holds D, A on C on B on table
- put-down(d:default),           // D on the table, robot hand empty, A on C on B
- unstack(a:default,c:default),   // Robot hand holds A, C on B
- put-down(a:default),           // A on the table, robot hand empty
- unstack(c:default,b:default),   // Robot hand holds C, B alone
- put-down(c:default),           // C on the table, robot hand empty
- pick-up(b:default),            // Robot hand holds B
- stack(b:default,d:default),    // B on D, robot hand empty
- pick-up(c:default),            // Robot hand holds C
- stack(c:default,b:default),    // C on B, robot hand empty
- pick-up(a:default),            // Robot hand holds A
- stack(a:default,c:default)     // A on C, achieving the goal state of A on C, C on B, B on D

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates an invalid formatting in the action sequence due to an erroneous character ('-') before 'unstack(d:default,a:default)'. This underscores the importance of precisely formatting actions according to the environment's requirements without any additional characters or errors. It's crucial to ensure that all actions are not only logically correct but also correctly formatted to be accepted by the system.

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D, a correct sequence of actions must be carefully planned starting from the valid action 'unstack(d:default,a:default)'. I must ensure that the robot hand is used efficiently to rearrange the blocks in the required order.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)

Error Feedback: The action sequence did not reach the goal. Below are the predicates that were not satisfied:
- on(a:default,b:default)
- on(b:default,c:default)
- on(c:default,d:default)

States Visited:
unstack(d:default,a:default):
In the current scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a robot hand. The current state of these objects is described as follows:

1. The robot hand is holding block d.
2. Block b is placed directly on the table.
3. Block a is positioned on top of block c.
4. Block c is stacked on top of block b.
5. Block a is clear, meaning there is no block on top of block a.

This setup forms a tower with block b at the base, block c above b, and block a at the top. Block d is being held by the robot hand and is not part of the tower.
put-down(d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and their relationship to other elements in the environment are as follows:

1. Block b is placed directly on the table.
2. Block d is also on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is placed on top of it.
3. Block c is stacked on top of block b.
4. Block a is stacked on top of block c and is clear, indicating that there is no block on top of block a.
5. The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to one another and the table, along with the status of the robot's hand.
unstack(a:default,c:default):
In the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and their status is as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block c is on top of block b and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block c.
- Block d is on the table and is also clear.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block a.

This setup indicates that blocks b and d are directly on the table, c is stacked on b, and a is not on the table but in the robot's hand. All blocks except b are clear, which means they can be interacted with or moved by the robot without needing to move other blocks first.
put-down(a:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot's hand is as follows:

- Block A is clear (meaning nothing is on top of it) and it is placed on the table.
- Block B is also on the table and has Block C on top of it, making Block C not clear.
- Block C, while on top of Block B, is clear.
- Block D is clear and on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the starting point or the current state in the environment, which is crucial for planning the next steps or actions to achieve a desired goal configuration of blocks.
unstack(c:default,b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A, B, and D are all placed on the table. Both blocks B and D, as well as block A, are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently holding block C.
put-down(c:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Presently:

- Blocks A, B, C, and D are all placed on the table.
- All these blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning no other block is stacked on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to pick up or manipulate the blocks as needed. 

This setup allows for any block to be picked up or moved without rearranging others first.
pick-up(b:default):
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all on the table. Furthermore, blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
stack(b:default,d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d, and a table. The current configuration of the blocks is as follows:
- Block b is on top of block d.
- Block a is clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block c is also clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block d is placed directly on the table and has block b on top of it, making it not clear.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. This setup involves blocks that are either stacked on each other or independently resting on the table, with some blocks being clear, indicating they can be manipulated by the robot.
pick-up(c:default):
In the current scenario within a Blocksworld domain involving blocks and a robot hand, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here is the status of each:

1. Block a is on the table and it has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block b is placed on top of block d and is also clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on b.
3. Block c is currently being held by the robot hand.
4. Block d is on the table.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks relative to each other, the table, and the robot's hand.
stack(c:default,b:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block A is on the table and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block B is directly under Block C.
3. Block C is on top of Block B and is clear.
4. Block D is on the table.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup describes the starting or current state of the blocks relative to each other and the status of the robot's hand in the Blocksworld domain.
pick-up(a:default):
In this Blocksworld scenario, there are four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd'.
- Block 'd' is placed directly on the table.
- Block 'c' is stacked on block 'b', making 'c' the topmost block in this stack.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it, allowing for further actions like stacking another block on it or moving it without obstruction. 

This environment setup allows for actions such as moving the clear block 'c', placing block 'a' on another block or the table, or rearranging the stack involving blocks 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
stack(a:default,c:default):
In this environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Block b is placed on top of block d, and block d is sitting directly on the table. Block a is positioned on block c, and block c itself is on top of block b, forming a vertical stack of blocks b, c, and a. Block a is clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot's hand:

1. Block D is placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action sequences attempted to rearrange the blocks but failed to achieve the goal configuration specified: block A on top of block B, block B on top of block C, and block C on top of block D. The feedback points out that none of the predicates about the correct stacking order were satisfied, indicating a fundamental miscalculation in the sequence of moves. 

Action Sequence: 
- unstack(d:default,a:default), // Robot's hand now holds D, stack is B-C-A
- put-down(d:default), // Put D on the table, stack is B-C-A, robot's hand is empty
- unstack(a:default,c:default), // Unstack A from C, robot's hand holds A, stack is B-C
- put-down(a:default), // Put A on the table, stacks are B-C and A separately
- unstack(c:default,b:default), // Unstack C from B, robot's hand holds C, B is alone
- put-down(c:default), // Put C on the table, all blocks are now separate: A, B, C
- pick-up(d:default), // Pick up D
- stack(d:default,b:default), // Stack D on B, blocks are B-D and A, C separately
- pick-up(c:default), // Pick up C
- stack(c:default,d:default), // Stack C on D, blocks are B-D-C and A separately
- pick-up(a:default), // Pick up A
- stack(a:default,c:default) // Stack A on C, final configuration is B-D-C-A, which is incorrect as per goal

Corrected Action Sequence to meet the goal:
- unstack(d:default,a:default), // Robot's hand holds D, stack is B-C-A
- put-down(d:default), // Place D on the table, stack is B-C-A, robot's hand is empty
- unstack(a:default,c:default), // Unstack A from C, robot's hand holds A, stack is B-C
- put-down(a:default), // Place A on the table, stacks are B-C and A separately
- unstack(c:default,b:default), // Unstack C from B, robot's hand holds C, B is alone
- put-down(c:default), // Place C on the table, all blocks are now separate: A, B, C
- pick-up(b:default), // Pick up B
- stack(b:default,c:default), // Stack B on C, stacks are C-B and A, D separately
- pick-up(a:default), // Pick up A
- stack(a:default,b:default), // Stack A on B, stacks are C-B-A and D separately

- Block a is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is also on the table and clear.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.

This setup involves blocks solely positioned on the table, each clear and accessible for manipulation. Block d is the exception as it is in the grasp of the robot hand, indicating potential for an action like putting it down on the table or stacking it on another block.
stack(d:default,b:default):
In this Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is clear and located on the table.
- Block B is also on the table and has Block D placed on top of it.

- Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.

In terms of accessibility:
- Block C and Block A are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them.

The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to either pick up any clear blocks or manipulate existing structures by stacking or unstacking to achieve a desired configuration.
pick-up(a:default):
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block c is positioned on block d, and block d is on block b. Block b is directly on the table. Block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot hand is holding block a.

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot's hand:

1. Block D is placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlights that the action 'stack(a:default,b:default)' was invalid due to the state of block B not being prepared to receive block A at that point. This underscores the need to ensure that each block is properly positioned and clear before attempting to stack another block on top of it. The valid actions were only to either put down block A or stack it on block C, which suggests that block A was not in a position to be stacked directly on block B at that moment.

To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D, we need to carefully manage the stacking order and ensure each move directly contributes towards this configuration.

Action Sequence:
1. unstack(d:default,a:default) - This moves block D from the top of stack B-C-A, holding it in the robot hand.
2. put-down(d:default) - Place block D on the table, clearing the robot's hand.
3. unstack(a:default,c:default) - Unstack block A from C, holding A in the robot's hand.
4. put-down(a:default) - Place block A on the table, making it and the robot's hand clear.
5. unstack(c:default,b:default) - Unstack block C from B, holding C in the robot's hand.
6. put-down(c:default) - Place block C on the table.
7. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up block D from the table.
8. stack(d:default,b:default) - Stack block D on top of block B.
9. pick-up(c:default) - Pick up block C from the table.
10. stack(c:default,d:default) - Stack block C on top of block D.
11. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up block A from the table.
12. stack(a:default,b:default) - Finally, stack block A on top of block B, aiming to achieve the correct order.

This sequence is designed to clear any blocks on top of each other and then methodically stack them in the order needed to reach the goal state. Each action is chosen based on the availability and clarity of the blocks involved.

1. Block D is placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that the action 'stack(a:default,b:default)' was invalid at the end of the sequence because block A was not in a position to be stacked on block B, and the valid actions available were 'put-down(a:default)' or 'stack(a:default,c:default)'. This indicates a mistake in the order or setup of blocks leading up to this action. We need to ensure that blocks are arranged in a way that will facilitate the desired end configuration.

Let's revise our action sequence to ensure that each block is properly positioned to achieve the goal state:

**Action Sequence:**
1. `unstack(d:default,a:default)` - Move D from on top of A, hand holds D.
2. `put-down(d:default)` - Place D on the table.
3. `unstack(a:default,c:default)` - Move A from on top of C, hand holds A.
4. `put-down(a:default)` - Place A on the table.
5. `unstack(c:default,b:default)` - Move C from on top of B, hand holds C.
6. `put-down(c:default)` - Place C on the table.
7. `pick-up(b:default)` - Hand picks up B.
8. `stack(b:default,d:default)` - Stack B on D.
9. `pick-up(c:default)` - Hand picks up C.
10. `stack(c:default,b:default)` - Stack C on B.
11. `pick-up(a:default)` - Hand picks up A.
12. `stack(a:default,c:default)` - Stack A on C.

This sequence is designed to sequentially dismantle the initial stack and rebuild it in the correct order to meet the goal state requirements: A on top of B, B on top of C, and C on top of D.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The repeated invalid action "stack(a:default,b:default)" indicates a persistent issue in understanding or planning the correct sequence to achieve the goal state. The feedback consistently shows that the action is not valid because the conditions required for stacking A on B are not met at that point in the sequence. This means we need to reassess and adjust the sequence to ensure that all blocks are in the correct position and clear for the desired action.

Revised Action Sequence: 
- unstack(d:default,a:default),  // Hand holds D, A is on C on B
- put-down(d:default),          // D on table, hand empty
- unstack(a:default,c:default), // Hand holds A, C on B
- put-down(a:default),          // A on table, hand empty
- unstack(c:default,b:default), // Hand holds C, B alone on table
- put-down(c:default),          // C on table, hand empty
- pick-up(b:default),           // Hand holds B
- stack(b:default,c:default),   // B on C, hand empty
- pick-up(a:default),           // Hand holds A
- stack(a:default,b:default),   // A on B, hand empty

- All these blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning no other block is stacked on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to pick up or manipulate the blocks as needed. 

This setup allows for any block to be picked up or moved without rearranging others first.
pick-up(d:default):
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. The current state of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is also on the table and clear.
- Block c is on the table and clear as well.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.

This setup involves blocks solely positioned on the table, each clear and accessible for manipulation. Block d is the exception as it is in the grasp of the robot hand, indicating potential for an action like putting it down on the table or stacking it on another block.
stack(d:default,b:default):
In this Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is clear and located on the table.
- Block B is also on the table and has Block D placed on top of it.
- Block C is clear and on the table.
- Block D is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup means that Blocks B, C, and D are accessible for manipulation by the robot, either to be picked up or to have another block stacked on top of them, while Block A is ready to have another block placed on it or be moved by the robot.
pick-up(c:default):
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows: Block A and Block B are both placed on the table. Block D is stacked on top of Block B. Blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding Block C.
stack(c:default,d:default):
The environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the blocks are arranged as follows:
- Block A and Block B are directly on the table.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.

In terms of accessibility:
- Block C and Block A are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them.

The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to either pick up any clear blocks or manipulate existing structures by stacking or unstacking to achieve a desired configuration.
pick-up(a:default):
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block c is positioned on block d, and block d is on block b. Block b is directly on the table. Block c is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot hand is holding block a.

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot's hand:

1. Block D is placed directly on the table.
2. Block B is at the base of a stack consisting of Blocks C, A, and D on top, in that order.
3. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup facilitates certain actions such as moving the top block or rearranging the stack since block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific stacking order must be achieved to meet the goal of the scenario.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It appears there's a misunderstanding in the sequence where block A is intended to be stacked on block B, yet the conditions aren't met. The feedback indicates that at that point, stacking A on B isn't possible, but A can be put down or stacked on C. This suggests that the arrangement of blocks beneath A (namely B and C) is not set up correctly to allow for the desired action sequence to meet the goal state.

Given the goal state requires A on B, B on C, and C on D, let's revise the approach to meet these requirements from the ground up, ensuring each block is correctly positioned and clear to receive another block on top.

**Revised Action Sequence**:
1. **unstack(d:default,a:default)** - This action will remove D from on top of A, which is not part of the final configuration and allows further manipulations with A, C, and B.
2. **put-down(d:default)** - Place D on the table. This clears the robot's hand and places D independently, which is its final required position.
3. **unstack(a:default,c:default)** - Remove A from on top of C. This is necessary to rearrange C underneath B.
4. **put-down(a:default)** - Place A on the table independently. This step is crucial to rearrange C and B.
5. **unstack(c:default,b:default)** - Remove C from on top of B. This step is necessary to rearrange B and C in the correct order.
6. **put-down(c:default)** - Place C on the table. C needs to be repositioned on top of D later.
7. **pick-up(b:default)** - Lift B in preparation to place it on top of C.
8. **stack(b:default,d:default)** - Place B on top of D. According to the goal, B should be above D.
9. **pick-up(c:default)** - Lift C to place it on top of B.
10. **stack(c:default,b:default)** - Stack C on B. C is now correctly positioned on top of B.
11. **pick-up(a:default)** - Lift A to place it on top of C.
12. **stack(a:default,c:default)** - Stack A on C. A is now correctly positioned on top of C.

This sequence aims to systematically arrange each block in the required configuration, starting from the base (D) and working upwards to meet the goal state.
