ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently on the table. Each block (A, B, C, and D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocks World environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block A should be placed on top of block B, block B on top of block D, and block C on top of block A. The arrangement should form a structure where some blocks are directly stacked on others, following the mentioned order.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first action sequence and there's no prior error feedback, I will start by exploring the valid actions given the initial state. The starting state has all blocks clear on the table and the robot hand is empty, which makes it possible to pick up any block.

Think: To reach the goal state of having A on B, B on D, and C on A, I must plan the sequence thoughtfully. Since B needs to be on top of D, I will start by positioning D and then stacking B on D. Next, I will position A on top of B. Finally, C needs to be stacked on A. The hand must be empty before picking up another block, so each pick-up action must be followed by a corresponding put-down or stack action.

Action Sequence: 
1. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up block D since it's free and needs to be the base for B.
2. put-down(d:default) - Put down D on the table (even though it's already there, this action ensures the robot's hand is empty to pick up B).
3. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up block B.
4. stack(b:default,d:default) - Stack B on D.
5. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up block A.
6. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stack A on B.
7. pick-up(c:default) - Pick up block C.
8. stack(c:default,a:default) - Stack C on A.

Considering the constraints and the valid actions, this sequence should achieve the goal state from the starting state.

Error Feedback: The action '1.pick-up(d:default)-PickupblockDsinceit'sfreeandneedstobethebaseforB.' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the action format was incorrect due to improper formatting and inclusion of additional text. The proper format for actions should be concise and only include the action command as described in the environment rules without additional commentary.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the correct sequence must start by manipulating block D, then B, followed by A and C. The robot's hand must first pick up block D, which will then allow stacking B on D, followed by A on B, and finally C on A.

Action Sequence: pick-up(d:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)
