ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here is the current configuration of these blocks and their related conditions:

- Block a is on top of block b, and block a is clear.
- Block b is on the table.
- Block c is on top of block d, and block c is clear.
- Block d is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks a and c are clear and can be moved, while block b and d are directly on the table, supporting blocks a and c respectively. The robot hand being empty suggests that it's ready to perform an action such as picking up a clear block.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block 'a' is on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. This requires a sequence of actions to move and stack the blocks in this specific order.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Considering the initial state and the goal, the blocks need to be rearranged to achieve the specified configuration. Currently, block a is already on b, so that part of the goal is already met. The challenge lies in placing block c on top of block a.

Think: The robot hand is empty, so it can pick up block c since it is clear. After picking up block c, block a must be accessible for stacking. Since block a is already on b and clear, I can directly stack c on a once c is picked up.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,d:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
