ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the robot's hand:

- Block 'b' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'a' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' is on top of block 'b'.
- Block 'a' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup indicates a vertical stack of blocks with 'b' at the bottom, 'c' in the middle, and 'a' at the top, and the robot's hand is not currently holding any block.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block B is placed on top of block C, and block C is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback, so the initial approach of evaluating the current state against the goal is appropriate. The starting state has block 'a' on top of 'c', which is on top of 'b', and the goal state requires 'b' on top of 'c', which is on top of 'a'. This indicates a need to rearrange the stack order completely.

Think: To reach the goal state from the starting state:
1. Unstack block 'a' from block 'c' (since it's clear and on top).
2. Place block 'a' down on the table.
3. Unstack block 'c' from block 'b'.
4. Stack block 'c' on block 'a' (reversing their order).
5. Pick up block 'b'.
6. Stack block 'b' on block 'c'.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)
