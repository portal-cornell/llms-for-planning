ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks are configured as follows: Block A and Block B are both directly on the table. Block C is positioned on top of Block B, and Block D is stacked on top of Block C. Both Blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty and available to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is placed on top of block C, and block B is positioned on top of block D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the first action sequence proposal, there is no previous feedback to reflect upon. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to achieve the configuration where block A is on top of block C and block B is on top of block D.

Think: To achieve the goal, steps need to be carefully planned from the starting state. Initially, the hand is empty, and the blocks are stacked with D on C, C on B, and A and B on the table. The robot must first clear the stack to access block C and then rearrange the blocks as required. The most direct approach involves unstacking the blocks in sequence and then stacking them as needed to achieve the final configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)"]
