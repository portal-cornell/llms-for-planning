ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The blocks A, B, and C are placed directly on the table. Block D is positioned on top of Block A. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of these blocks. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations such as picking up or moving blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This specific configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that manipulate the blocks and the robot hand. The actions available include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block onto another, and unstacking one block from another.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback, so the previous action sequence either did not occur or did not have errors. The goal is to achieve a specific configuration of blocks: B on D and D on A. The initial state has D on A already, which is part of the goal state. I need to ensure B is placed on D, but before doing so, B must be picked up as itâ€™s directly on the table.

Think: To achieve the goal configuration, initially, I should focus on manipulating Block D and Block B without disturbing the current stack of D on A. Since B and C are clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty, my viable move is to pick up B. I must then arrange for D to still be on A while placing B on top of D. 

Action Sequence: pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)"]
