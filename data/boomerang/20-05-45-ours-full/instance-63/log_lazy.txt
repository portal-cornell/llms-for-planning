ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current Blocksworld scenario, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their states:

1. Block A is placed on top of Block C.
2. Block B and Block D are both on the table.
3. Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
4. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup describes a state where the blocks are distributed with one on top of another and two directly on the table, ready for manipulation according to the goal of the problem.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to rearrange blocks so that block B is on top of block C and block C is on top of block D. This setup is part of a task where blocks are manipulated to achieve a specific configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial attempt at generating an action sequence with the given scenario, there's no prior feedback to reflect on. Understanding the initial starting state and the goal state is crucial for planning the correct sequence of actions.

Think: The goal is to stack B on C and C on D. Currently, B and D are on the table, and A is on C. The robot's hand is empty. To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Clear C by removing A from it.
2. Stack C on D since D is already on the table and clear.
3. Finally, stack B on C.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
