ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment setup, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a summary of the state of each object and the overall environment:

1. Block A is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is also on the table and clear.
3. Block C is placed on top of Block B and is clear.
4. Block D is on the table and clear.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This arrangement suggests that the blocks are mostly on the table except for Block C, which is stacked on Block B. Each block that is on the table is clear, indicating no other block is on top of it, and the robot hand is not holding any blocks, ready for any action to reconfigure the blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B. This setup requires stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the initial state, blocks A, B, and D are all clear and on the table, with block C stacked on block B. The robot hand is empty. The goal is to stack B on A and D on B. To achieve this, block C must be moved from B, and then B can be moved and stacked as required.

Think: Since block C is on B and needs to be moved, the first action should be to unstack C from B. After unstacking C, the robot can put down C on the table, since block A needs to be clear to stack B on it. Then, pick up B and stack it on A. Finally, pick up D and stack it on B to achieve the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
