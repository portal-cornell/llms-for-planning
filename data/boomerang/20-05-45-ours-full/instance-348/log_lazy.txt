ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the environment described, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each block is placed in a specific configuration:

- Block A is on the table and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block D is not directly on the table but is instead under Block C, and it is on top of Block B.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup allows for actions to be taken, such as moving blocks, since there are clear blocks and the hand is not occupied.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the ultimate objective is to arrange the blocks such that block A is positioned directly on top of block D, and block C is placed directly on top of block A. This configuration will satisfy the goal conditions specified.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first sequence, there are no previous errors or feedback to reflect upon. The initial state of the blocks and the description of valid actions provide a clear starting point.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A, a sequence of actions must be carefully planned considering the robot's ability to only manipulate clear blocks and the condition that its hand can hold only one block at a time. The valid actions indicate the robot can pick up block A or unstack block C from D. Since block D needs to be clear to place block A on it, unstacking C from D is necessary first.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)
