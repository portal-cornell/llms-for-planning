ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is positioned on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block C.
- Block D is also on the table and has nothing stacked on top of it, making it clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves the blocks being arranged in a stack from A at the base, with C on A, and B on C, while D is separate and clear on the table.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block D is positioned on top of block B. This configuration will require the robot to execute a series of actions, potentially involving picking up, stacking, and unstacking blocks, to achieve the desired arrangement of block A on block D and block D on block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
There is no error feedback, implying the new sequence of actions has not yet been attempted. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a specific configuration, and the valid actions available involve manipulating block B, C, and D. The current state with block B on top of C and both above A, and D being clear, suggests that manipulations will be centered around unstacking and restacking to achieve the goal.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state where block A is on block D and block D is on block B, I need to consider an efficient sequence of actions:
1. Begin by making block A accessible. This requires unstacking block B from C and then unstacking block C from A.
2. Once block A is free, I can proceed to reconfigure blocks D and B to form the base and middle of the desired stack.
3. Since block D is already clear, I can directly move block A onto block D after block D is stacked on block B.

Action Sequence:
1. unstack(b:default,c:default), 
2. put-down(b:default), 
3. unstack(c:default,a:default),
4. put-down(c:default),
5. pick-up(d:default),
6. stack(d:default,b:default),
7. pick-up(a:default),
8. stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicated that the action 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' was invalid despite it being listed as a valid action. This could be due to a formatting issue or misunderstanding of the action's usage. The action sequence should be formatted without numbers or extra characters to ensure it matches the expected input format of the environment.

Think: To proceed, I will format the actions correctly by stripping extraneous characters and ensuring the sequence is properly listed. The goal requires stacking block A on block D and then block D on block B. To achieve this, I need to first free up block B by unstacking it from C, then manipulate block D, and finally rearrange block A.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(d:default)' at index 1 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)

States Visited:
unstack(b:default,c:default):
In the described environment:

- The robot is currently holding block B.
- Block A and block D are both on the table.
- Block C is on top of block A.
- Both blocks D and C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

These blocks and their current positions constitute the state of the environment, which is essential for planning the next actions.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is positioned on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block C.
- Block D is also on the table and has nothing stacked on top of it, making it clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves the blocks being arranged in a stack from A at the base, with C on A, and B on C, while D is separate and clear on the table.

- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block D is positioned on top of block B. This configuration will require the robot to execute a series of actions, potentially involving picking up, stacking, and unstacking blocks, to achieve the desired arrangement of block A on block D and block D on block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The invalid action 'pick-up(d:default)' occurred because the robot was already holding block B, and in this state, it must either put down or stack the block it is holding before it can pick up another. The valid actions suggested stacking block B or putting it down, which aligns with the robot's current state of holding a block.

Think: To move towards the goal state, the robot should first utilize block B by stacking it on block D to start forming part of the goal configuration. After stacking B on D, the robot should manipulate block C to clear block A, allowing it to be positioned on top of block D as required by the goal state.

Action Sequence: stack(b:default,d:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It appears there was a misunderstanding in tracking the states visited between action proposals, leading to an assumption that the robot still held block B. The error feedback clarifies that the robot's hand is actually empty, and the initial starting state is still in effect where Block B is on top of Block C. The correct actions should directly relate to this setup, starting with handling Blocks B and C.

Think: Given the current starting state and the goal, the robot needs to manipulate the blocks so that block A ends up on block D, and block D on block B. The immediate actionable step involves using 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' to free up Block B and then strategically reposition it and other blocks to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)
