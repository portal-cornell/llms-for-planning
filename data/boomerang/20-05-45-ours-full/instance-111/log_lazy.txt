ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Given the current stack configuration D, B, A, C (from bottom to top) and the goal state of D, C, B, A, the actions must involve unstacking and stacking to reorder these blocks. The robot's hand is currently empty, which allows it to perform an unstack action initially.

Think:
To reach the goal state, we need to rearrange the blocks as follows:
1. Unstack C from A (since C is clear and on top).
2. Put down C on the table (to temporarily hold it while rearranging other blocks).
3. Unstack A from B (now A is clear and on top).
4. Stack A on top of D (according to the goal state).
5. Pick up C from the table.
6. Stack C on top of B (completing the part of the goal state).
7. Unstack B from D (since we need D at the bottom).
8. Stack B on top of A (as per the goal state).
9. Pick up D.
10. Stack D on the table (since it should be on the bottom).

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,b:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), put-down(d:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(a:default,d:default)' at index 3 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:

- Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding Block C. This setup describes the initial configuration and the state of each object in the Blocksworld scenario.
put-down(c:default):
In the given scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, block A is directly on top of block B, and block B is on top of block D. Both blocks C and D are placed directly on the table. Block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup forms the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd', and both block 'c' and block 'd' are on the table. Blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup forms the initial state or configuration of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the action 'stack(a:default,d:default)' was invalid because Block A could not be stacked on Block D at that point in the sequence. Valid actions at that step included putting down Block A or stacking it on Blocks B or C. This highlights the importance of considering the current configuration carefully and ensuring that the target block for stacking is clear.

Think: From the initial state, we can begin by moving Block C since it's at the top and clear. Then, we unstack Block A from Block B. After that, we must revisit our sequence to correctly position the blocks to meet the goal configuration. Given the valid actions after Block A is unstacked, we need to put it down and later reposition it according to the goal state's requirements.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action 'unstack(b:default,d:default)' at index 8 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:

- Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding Block C. This setup describes the initial configuration and the state of each object in the Blocksworld scenario.
put-down(c:default):
In the given scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, block A is directly on top of block B, and block B is on top of block D. Both blocks C and D are placed directly on the table. Block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup forms the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd', and both block 'c' and block 'd' are on the table. Blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup forms the initial state or configuration of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
put-down(a:default):
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s the current configuration of the blocks and other elements:

1. Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
2. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
3. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup represents a snapshot of the state in a Blocksworld scenario, where the goal typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration.
pick-up(c:default):
In the environment, there are four objects labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block 'a' is on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd' and is also clear.
- Block 'd' is on the table, but it is not clear because block 'b' is on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'c'.
stack(c:default,b:default):
In the current Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's a description of their arrangement and the state of the robot hand:

1. Block a is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block b has block c on top of it, and it itself is on top of block d.
3. Block c, being on block b, is not clear as block d is beneath it.
4. Block d is directly on the table, but it is not clear because block b is on top of it.
5. The robot hand is empty at the moment.

The goal in this environment will typically involve rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using the robot's actions: picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
pick-up(a:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current state of these blocks is as follows:

- Block B is placed on top of Block D.
- Block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block D is on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block B.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block A.

This setup involves multiple blocks being stacked on top of each other, and the robot hand actively holding a block, which is crucial for planning further movement or rearrangement of the blocks.
stack(a:default,c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A is on top of block C and block A is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block B is positioned on top of block D, while block C itself is placed on block B, forming a stack. Block D is directly on the table. The robot’s hand is empty at the moment.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.

3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The attempt to unstack Block B from Block D was invalid because Block B was not clear at the time, owing to Block C being on top of it. The current state after rearranging blocks allowed only unstacking Block A from Block C. This indicates that I need to adjust the sequence to ensure each target block for unstacking is clear and accessible.

Think: To achieve the goal state (D, C, B, A), I need to carefully sequence the actions to ensure blocks are clear for unstacking and stacking. Starting from the current arrangement (D, B, C, A with A on top), I should first make all blocks accessible by putting down blocks on the table and then re-stack them in the required order.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action sequence did not reach the goal. Below are the predicates that were not satisfied:
- on(a:default,c:default)
- on(d:default,a:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:

- Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding Block C. This setup describes the initial configuration and the state of each object in the Blocksworld scenario.
put-down(c:default):
In the given scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, block A is directly on top of block B, and block B is on top of block D. Both blocks C and D are placed directly on the table. Block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup forms the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd', and both block 'c' and block 'd' are on the table. Blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup forms the initial state or configuration of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
put-down(a:default):
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s the current configuration of the blocks and other elements:

1. Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
2. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
3. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup represents a snapshot of the state in a Blocksworld scenario, where the goal typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration.
unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all positioned on the table. Each of these blocks (A, C, D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This allows for potential actions such as moving any of these clear blocks or placing block B on any of them if needed.
put-down(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is resting on the table, and each block is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. The setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed, given that all blocks are accessible and the robot hand is ready to perform actions.
pick-up(a:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The situation is as follows:
- Block B is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, meaning it is clear.
- Block C is also on the table and clear.
- Block D is on the table and clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block A.

This setup indicates that the blocks B, C, and D are positioned directly on the table and each is free of any other blocks on top, allowing for potential manipulation. Block A is not on the table as it is being held by the robot's hand. This configuration is crucial for planning the next steps in block manipulation, whether it involves placing A down or stacking it on any of the other clear blocks.
stack(a:default,d:default):
In the described environment, the configuration of blocks and the status of the robot hand include the following:

- Block 'a' is on top of block 'd', and block 'a' is clear.
- Block 'b' is on the table and is also clear.
- Block 'c' is on the table and is clear.
- Block 'd' is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves four blocks (a, b, c, d) in a scenario where some blocks are stacked while others are placed directly on the table. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks at the moment, indicating readiness for an action such as picking up or stacking blocks.
pick-up(b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Block C is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it, and it is also placed on the table. Block D is also on the table. Block A is positioned on top of block D and is clear. This setup of blocks and their status forms the basis for the robot's actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
stack(b:default,a:default):
In the current state of the blocks world environment, the blocks named 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are arranged as follows:
- Block 'b' is on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'a' itself is placed on top of block 'd'.
- Both blocks 'c' and 'd' are directly on the table.
- Block 'b' and block 'c' are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty and available for operations such as picking up or manipulating blocks.
pick-up(c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block B is placed on top of Block A, and Block A is on top of Block D. Block D is sitting directly on the table. Currently, the robot hand is holding Block C. Additionally, Block B is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
stack(c:default,b:default):
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block B is positioned on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B, forming a stack from A to C. Block A is on top of block D, which is directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty, and block C is the only block that is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous sequence of actions did not achieve the goal state, as it did not satisfy the conditions where Block A should be on top of Block C, and Block D should be on top of Block A. Adjustments are necessary to ensure that the stacking order aligns precisely with the goal requirements.

Think: To achieve the goal state of A on C, C on B, and D on A, a complete reevaluation of the sequence is needed. First, blocks must be unstacked and placed on the table to allow for re-stacking in the correct order. The sequence should handle each block correctly and avoid stacking blocks that will need to be moved again for the final configuration.

Action Sequence:
- unstack(c:default,a:default), // C is in hand, A is now clear on top of B
- put-down(c:default), // C is on the table, hand is empty
- unstack(a:default,b:default), // A is in hand, B is now clear on top of D
- put-down(a:default), // A is on the table, hand is empty
- unstack(b:default,d:default), // B is in hand, D is now clear
- put-down(b:default), // B is on the table, hand is empty
- pick-up(d:default), // D is in hand
- stack(d:default,a:default), // D on A, hand is empty
- pick-up(c:default), // C is in hand
- stack(c:default,b:default), // C on B, hand is empty
- pick-up(a:default), // A is in hand (A is on top of D)
- stack(a:default,c:default) // A on C, final configuration matches the goal state

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates a formatting mistake in the proposed action sequence where I incorrectly prefixed a hyphen to 'unstack(c:default,a:default)'. This was a typographical error, and the action itself was valid but not correctly formatted.

Think: I need to carefully format the actions without any prefix or typos and ensure that the sequence logically progresses towards the goal state. Based on the current configuration of the blocks and the goal state, the sequence needs to rearrange the blocks correctly.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlights that the action 'pick-up(a:default)' was invalid due to A not being clear at that point, as it was underneath D. Valid actions included unstacking B from C or D from A, indicating a need to reconsider the sequence to effectively rearrange the blocks according to the goal state configuration.

Think: To achieve the goal state where A is on top of C, C on top of B, and D on top of A, we must carefully sequence the unstacking and restacking actions. We need to ensure that each block to be moved is clear and the robot's hand is available. The previous sequence had logical errors in positioning and order.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(c:default,a:default) - Robot hand picks up C from A.
2. put-down(c:default) - Places C on the table, making it clear.
3. unstack(a:default,b:default) - Robot hand picks up A from B.
4. put-down(a:default) - Places A on the table, making it clear.
5. unstack(b:default,d:default) - Robot hand picks up B from D.
6. put-down(b:default) - Places B on the table, making it clear.
7. pick-up(d:default) - Robot hand picks up D.
8. stack(d:default,a:default) - Places D on top of A.
9. pick-up(c:default) - Robot hand picks up C.
10. stack(c:default,b:default) - Places C on top of B.
11. pick-up(a:default) - Robot hand picks up A from under D.
12. stack(a:default,c:default) - Places A on top of C. 

This sequence should correctly reposition the blocks to meet the goal state configuration.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action '1.unstack(c:default,a:default)-RobothandpicksupCfromA.' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)

States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the previous response included unnecessary annotations and a misformatted action syntax. The action itself was correct but required a plain format without additional descriptions or numbering.

Think: To align with the goal state configuration, I need to carefully sequence the actions that unstack and restack the blocks in the desired order. Starting with the valid initial action to unstack C from A, I'll need to strategically place C and then rearrange A, B, and D to achieve the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(a:default)' at index 10 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:

- Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding Block C. This setup describes the initial configuration and the state of each object in the Blocksworld scenario.
put-down(c:default):
In the given scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, block A is directly on top of block B, and block B is on top of block D. Both blocks C and D are placed directly on the table. Block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup forms the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd', and both block 'c' and block 'd' are on the table. Blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup forms the initial state or configuration of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
put-down(a:default):
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s the current configuration of the blocks and other elements:

1. Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
2. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
3. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup represents a snapshot of the state in a Blocksworld scenario, where the goal typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration.
unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all positioned on the table. Each of these blocks (A, C, D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This allows for potential actions such as moving any of these clear blocks or placing block B on any of them if needed.
put-down(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is resting on the table, and each block is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. The setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed, given that all blocks are accessible and the robot hand is ready to perform actions.
pick-up(d:default):
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block 'a' is on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear.
- Block 'c' is on the table and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'd'.
stack(d:default,a:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block a is on the table with block d stacked on top of it. Both blocks b and c are also on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block d is also clear. The robot's hand is empty at this moment. This setup indicates various possibilities for the robot to manipulate the blocks, such as picking up any clear blocks or stacking them on others, considering the current clear and handempty status.
pick-up(b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. Block A is situated on the table. Block D is stacked on top of block A, and block C is also on the table. Both blocks C and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
stack(b:default,c:default):
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. Currently:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block D is placed on top of Block A and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block C is also on the table.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any block at the moment.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback has highlighted that the action 'pick-up(a:default)' was invalid because Block A was not clear at that stage. This error occurred because I misunderstood the configuration resulting from previous actions. The valid actions at that point were 'unstack(b:default,c:default)' and 'unstack(d:default,a:default)', indicating that either Block B was on top of Block C or Block D was on top of Block A. This suggests that my previous plan did not align the blocks correctly according to the goal state requirements.

Action Sequence:
1. unstack(c:default,a:default) - Removes C from on top of A, C in hand, A clear.
2. put-down(c:default) - Places C on the table, hand empty.
3. unstack(a:default,b:default) - Removes A from on top of B, A in hand, B clear.
4. put-down(a:default) - Places A on the table, hand empty.
5. unstack(b:default,d:default) - Removes B from on top of D, B in hand, D clear.
6. put-down(b:default) - Places B on the table, hand empty.
7. pick-up(d:default) - Picks up D, D in hand.
8. stack(d:default,a:default) - Places D on top of A, D not clear, A not clear.
9. pick-up(c:default) - Picks up C from the table, C in hand.
10. stack(c:default,b:default) - Places C on top of B, C not clear, B not clear.
11. pick-up(a:default) - Picks up A from under D, A in hand.
12. stack(a:default,c:default) - Places A on top of C, aligning to the goal state configuration.

This revised sequence takes into account the necessity of ensuring that each block to be picked up or stacked is clear and accessible, respecting the constraints that only clear blocks can be manipulated.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The repeated error feedback indicates that the action 'pick-up(a:default)' was invalid because Block A was not clear, and therefore not available for picking up directly. The valid actions at the state were 'unstack(a:default,c:default)' and 'unstack(b:default,d:default)', suggesting that the configurations of blocks were not in positions that I anticipated earlier. It's essential to track the state of each block accurately and ensure clear paths for actions that align with the goal state requirements.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It appears that the crucial error in the previous attempts was trying to pick up Block A directly when it was not clear. The valid actions indicated that Block A was either under Block D or Block C was on top of Block B. These insights imply that the structure of the blocks was not fully aligned with the intended setup leading to the goal state. My earlier sequences were not accurately transitioning the blocks to the required positions for the desired final configuration.

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:

- Block B is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block D is directly on the table.
- Block A is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding Block C. This setup describes the initial configuration and the state of each object in the Blocksworld scenario.
put-down(c:default):
In the given scenario, the environment consists of four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Currently, block A is directly on top of block B, and block B is on top of block D. Both blocks C and D are placed directly on the table. Block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup forms the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd', and both block 'c' and block 'd' are on the table. Blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup forms the initial state or configuration of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
put-down(a:default):
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s the current configuration of the blocks and other elements:

1. Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
2. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
3. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup represents a snapshot of the state in a Blocksworld scenario, where the goal typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration.
unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all positioned on the table. Each of these blocks (A, C, D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This allows for potential actions such as moving any of these clear blocks or placing block B on any of them if needed.
put-down(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is resting on the table, and each block is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. The setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed, given that all blocks are accessible and the robot hand is ready to perform actions.
pick-up(d:default):
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block 'a' is on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear.
- Block 'c' is on the table and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'd'.
stack(d:default,a:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block a is on the table with block d stacked on top of it. Both blocks b and c are also on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block d is also clear. The robot's hand is empty at this moment. This setup indicates various possibilities for the robot to manipulate the blocks, such as picking up any clear blocks or stacking them on others, considering the current clear and handempty status.
pick-up(b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. Block A is situated on the table. Block D is stacked on top of block A, and block C is also on the table. Both blocks C and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
stack(b:default,c:default):
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. Currently:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block D is placed on top of Block A and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block C is also on the table.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any block at the moment.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The continued invalid attempt to pick up Block A when it was not clear suggests a misunderstanding or oversight of the block configuration after each action. The valid actions indicate that Block A was either under Block D or there was another configuration where Block B was on top of Block C, which wasn't accounted for in the action sequence. Accurate tracking of the block's state and ensuring that each block is in a viable position for the intended action is crucial.

Action Sequence: 
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- put-down(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- put-down(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- put-down(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- pick-up(a:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)

This revised sequence should address the placement errors and help reach the goal state where Block A is on top of Block C, Block C is on top of Block B, and Block D is on top of Block A.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The persistent issue with trying to pick up Block A directly suggests a misunderstanding of the block configuration immediately before this action. Revisiting the sequence, it seems that there was an error in the manipulation of blocks which led to Block A being in an un-pickable state, likely under another block or part of a stack that wasn't adequately addressed.

Adjusting the sequence based on the valid actions provided ('unstack(b:default,c:default)', 'unstack(d:default,a:default)'), we need to ensure Block A is clear before attempting to move it, which involves rearranging the order of actions to correctly unstack and stack the blocks as needed.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(c:default,a:default)
2. put-down(c:default)
3. unstack(a:default,b:default)
4. put-down(a:default)
5. unstack(b:default,d:default)
6. put-down(b:default)

Both blocks C and D are placed directly on the table. Block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup forms the initial state of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
unstack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd', and both block 'c' and block 'd' are on the table. Blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup forms the initial state or configuration of the blocks and the robot hand in the environment.
put-down(a:default):
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s the current configuration of the blocks and other elements:

1. Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
2. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
3. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
4. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup represents a snapshot of the state in a Blocksworld scenario, where the goal typically involves rearranging these blocks into a different configuration.
unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are all positioned on the table. Each of these blocks (A, C, D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. This allows for potential actions such as moving any of these clear blocks or placing block B on any of them if needed.
put-down(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is resting on the table, and each block is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. The setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed, given that all blocks are accessible and the robot hand is ready to perform actions.
pick-up(d:default):
In the environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The current configuration is as follows:
- Block 'a' is on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and is clear.
- Block 'c' is on the table and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'd'.
stack(d:default,a:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block a is on the table with block d stacked on top of it. Both blocks b and c are also on the table and are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block d is also clear. The robot's hand is empty at this moment. This setup indicates various possibilities for the robot to manipulate the blocks, such as picking up any clear blocks or stacking them on others, considering the current clear and handempty status.
pick-up(c:default):
In the given environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is also on the table and it is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
- Block D is placed on top of Block A and it is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block C. 

This setup is part of the Blocks World domain where the objective is typically to rearrange the blocks into a specified configuration using a series of moves by the robot hand.
stack(c:default,b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. Blocks a and b are placed directly on the table. Blocks d and c are positioned on top of blocks a and b, respectively. The robot's hand is currently empty. Additionally, blocks c and d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The repeated invalid action feedback for "pick-up(a:default)" and the valid options provided suggest that A is not in a state to be picked up directly due to its position in the configuration. The valid actions hint that Block A is still under Block D or other configurations exist that I need to manage first. This indicates a pattern where my action sequence does not effectively address the real-time block setup, causing repeated errors in trying to manipulate Block A.

To address this, I need to ensure that Block A is clear before attempting to manipulate it, which requires adjusting previous steps to correctly position other blocks.

Action Sequence:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- put-down(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- put-down(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- put-down(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
- pick-up(a:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)

This sequence revises the approach by ensuring each block is appropriately positioned and clear before attempting further manipulation, aligning with the provided valid actions and aiming to avoid the repetitive mistake concerning Block A.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action '-unstack(c:default,a:default)' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)

States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block D is on the table.
2. Block B is directly on top of Block D.
3. Block A is directly on top of Block B.
4. Block C is directly on top of Block A.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.

In summary, the blocks are stacked in a single tower from the table upwards in the order D, B, A, C, with C being at the top and clear. The robot's hand is not holding any blocks, indicating it is ready to perform an action such as picking up the clear block or manipulating others, according to the next commands in the plan.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This setup forms a particular stacking order among the blocks to achieve the desired end state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE

Reflect: The error feedback highlights a formatting issue with the action command. The correct action is 'unstack(c:default,a:default)', but the hyphen at the beginning of the action sequence made it invalid. It is crucial to strictly adhere to the correct syntax without any additional characters to ensure the action is recognized correctly by the system.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)
