ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are five blocks labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The arrangement and state of these blocks are as follows:

- Block D is placed on top of Block C.
- Block E is stacked on Block A.
- Block A is on top of Block D.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- Both Blocks B and E are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup forms a complex structure where some blocks support others, and the robot hand's availability allows for potential manipulation of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(e:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block E, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the initial scenario, there isn't previous feedback or errors to reflect on. The environment consists of blocks in a specific arrangement and the robot hand's ability to manipulate these blocks. Understanding the actions allowed and the goal state is crucial.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state:
1. Block B must be on top of Block D, which is on top of Block C. Currently, Block D is on top of Block C which aligns with the goal state, so this part is correct.
2. Block A needs to be on top of Block E, but currently, Block E is on top of Block A. This needs to be reversed.
3. The robot hand is empty and can be used to rearrange the blocks.

Considering the starting state and the valid actions, the sequence of actions should:
- Start by clearing Block A since Block E is on it. This requires moving Block E.
- The robot hand can then be used to rearrange the blocks to achieve the desired final configuration.

Action Sequence:
unstack(e:default,a:default), put-down(e:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,e:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(e:default,a:default)", "put-down(e:default)", "unstack(a:default,d:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,e:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(e:default,a:default)", "put-down(e:default)", "unstack(a:default,d:default)", "stack(a:default,e:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)"]
