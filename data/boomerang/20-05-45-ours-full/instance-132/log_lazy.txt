ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and each block is interacting with others or placed on a table in various ways. Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first attempt, there are no previous reflections or error feedback to refer to. The initial state has block a on the table and clear, block d on the table, block b on top of block d, and block c is clear on top of block b. The goal is for block a to be on block d, block b on block c, and block d on block b, which suggests we need to rearrange the blocks significantly.

Think: To reach the goal state, the robot hand must be used efficiently to rearrange the blocks. Starting with the hand empty:
1. Unstack block c from block b since c needs to end up below b.
2. Put down block c on the table to temporarily clear the hand and prepare block b to be moved.
3. Pick up block a because it needs to go on top of block d.
4. Put down block a on the table temporarily to deal with block d.
5. Unstack block b from block d since block d needs to end up below block b.
6. Put down block b on the table temporarily.
7. Pick up block d to move it under block b.
8. Stack block d on top of block c (since the goal is d on b, b on c).
9. Pick up block b.
10. Stack block b on top of block d.
11. Pick up block a.
12. Stack block a on top of block d to achieve the final desired configuration of a on d, b on c, and d on b.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(a:default,d:default)' at index 11 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,b:default):
In the current scenario, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block a is directly on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is positioned on top of block d and is also clear with no other blocks on top of it.
- Block d is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup forms the environment in which actions such as moving blocks and repositioning them through stacking or unstacking will occur.
put-down(c:default):

- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear and is on the table.
- Block B is also clear.
- The robot's hand is empty.
- Block C is clear and is on the table.
- Block D is on the table.

This setup indicates that the blocks are positioned with B on D, while blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table. All blocks except D are clear, meaning they have no other blocks on top of them, and the robot hand is not holding any blocks.
pick-up(a:default):
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks or items: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The scenario is set up as follows:

- Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd'.
- Both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- Blocks 'd' and 'c' are placed directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block 'a'.

This setup is part of a blocksworld domain where the objective typically involves reconfiguring these blocks into a new specified arrangement using a series of actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.

put-down(b:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, all blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on top of them. Each of these blocks is placed directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed, given that all are accessible and the robot's hand is ready to perform actions.
pick-up(d:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a summary of their states:

- Block A is clear and placed on the table.
- Block B is also clear and positioned on the table.
- Block C is clear and located on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block D.

Each block is accessible and free from having other blocks on top of them, making them easy to manipulate as needed. The robot can perform actions such as placing down block D or manipulating other blocks to achieve a desired configuration.

pick-up(b:default):
In the current scenario within a Blocksworld domain, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Block A is placed on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it. Block C is also on the table, but block D is stacked on top of block C, and block D itself is clear. This setup of blocks and the status of the robot's hand defines the environment's state, crucial for planning the next actions to reconfigure the blocks as desired.
stack(b:default,d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it. Block B is on top of block D and is also clear. Block C is on the table. Block D is on top of block C. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks at the moment.
pick-up(a:default):
In this environment, the objects consist of four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block b is placed on top of block d.
2. Block d is directly on top of block c.
3. Block c is positioned on the table.
4. The robot hand is currently holding block a.
5. Block b is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.

This setup describes the initial state or configuration of blocks in the environment where the robot interacts.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and each block is interacting with others or placed on a table in various ways. Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback shows that the action 'stack(a:default,d:default)' was invalid because a was not clear at that moment; instead, it could be stacked on b but not on d. The sequence needs to be adjusted based on the valid actions provided at the state before the error, which were 'put-down(a:default)' or 'stack(a:default,b:default)'. This indicates a need to better align the sequence of block manipulations with the goal state requirements and the constraints of block clearness.

Think: The goal is to have a on d, b on c, and d on b. The error occurred because block a was not clear to be stacked on d. I need to ensure that the blocks are clear before attempting to stack them. Given the error, I need to correct the sequence from the point where block a was initially intended to be stacked on d. I will modify the action sequence to maintain the valid state transitions and achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block C is directly on the table.
- The top of Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on it.
- The robot's hand is empty at this moment. 

This setup implies a vertical stack of blocks A, B, D, with C being at the base directly on the table, and no other blocks or items interfering above Block A. The goal in such a scenario typically involves rearranging these blocks to achieve a different specified configuration, utilizing the robot's ability to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and each block is interacting with others or placed on a table in various ways. Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that 'pick-up(d:default)' was invalid because block d was not clear and thus not pickable in that state. Instead, the only valid action was 'unstack(a:default,b:default)', indicating a misunderstanding of the block stacking state in the action sequence planning. It is crucial to ensure that blocks to be picked up or unstacked are clear and accessible.

Think: Given the goal state requirements and the states visited, it's clear that the sequence of stacking and unstacking needs careful consideration to maintain the clear status of blocks and to follow the valid actions available at each state. The aim is to rearrange the blocks in a way that each action logically follows from the state created by the previous action, always ensuring that blocks are clear before attempting to move them.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(c:default,b:default), 
2. put-down(c:default), 
3. unstack(b:default,d:default), 
4. put-down(b:default), 
5. pick-up(a:default), 
6. stack(a:default,d:default), 
7. pick-up(b:default), 
8. stack(b:default,c:default), 
9. pick-up(d:default), 
10. stack(d:default,b:default)

This sequence ensures that each action is valid based on the state of clarity of each block and adheres closely to the structure required to reach the goal state.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action '1.unstack(c:default,b:default)' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)

States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and each block is interacting with others or placed on a table in various ways. Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates a misunderstanding, as the given action ('unstack(c:default,b:default)') was indeed valid and aligned with the stated valid actions. The error might be due to the format of the response where action was prefixed with a numbering '1.' which could have been misinterpreted by the validation system. We need to ensure the format strictly follows the environment's requirements without additional characters or numbering.

Think: Based on the stated goal and the starting state, the correct sequence to rearrange the blocks involves unstacking c from b, manipulating a, b, and d appropriately, and stacking them to meet the goal configuration. Care must be taken to ensure each action is valid based on the current state of the environment.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are positioned on the table. Each of these blocks, A, C, and D, is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them, allowing for potential manipulation or movement.
put-down(b:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, all blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on top of them. Each of these blocks is placed directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed, given that all are accessible and the robot's hand is ready to perform actions.
pick-up(d:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is a summary of their states:

- Block A is clear and placed on the table.
- Block B is also clear and positioned on the table.
- Block C is clear and located on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block D.

Each block is accessible and free from having other blocks on top of them, making them easy to manipulate as needed. The robot can perform actions such as placing down block D or manipulating other blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
stack(d:default,b:default):
In the current state of the environment, which comprises blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D and a robot hand, the configuration is as follows:

In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Blocks A and B are placed directly on the table. Block C is on top of Block A, and Block D is on top of Block B, making both Blocks C and D clear and accessible. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it's ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and each block is interacting with others or placed on a table in various ways. Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicated that the action 'pick-up(a:default)' was invalid because at that state, block a was not free to be picked up as it had block c stacked on top of it. The valid actions were 'unstack(c:default,a:default)' or 'unstack(d:default,b:default)', which points out the mistake of attempting to pick up a block that was not clear. This emphasizes the importance of ensuring a block is clear (i.e., nothing is on top of it) before trying to pick it up.

Think: To rectify the previous sequence, it's essential to focus on the correct unstacking actions first before attempting to pick up or stack any blocks. The goal is to achieve the configuration where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. Therefore, I need to adjust the sequence to respect the rules of the environment regarding which blocks are clear and can be manipulated.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicated that attempting to pick up block B when it was not clear was invalid. At the point of error, block D was on top of block B, negating the possibility of picking it up directly.

This summary captures all the predicates and objects mentioned, detailing the state of each block and the robot hand in the Blocksworld setup.
pick-up(d:default):
In the current environment setup of the Blocksworld, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the state of these objects:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block d is being held by the robot's hand.
- Block b is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block b is positioned on top of block c.
- Block c is directly on top of block a.

This setup involves a stack comprising blocks c and a on the table, with block b resting on block c, while block d is held by the robot and not on the table or any other block. Block b is also clear, providing an opportunity for the robot to perform actions like stacking another block on b if needed.
stack(d:default,b:default):
In the current environment setup:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block D is placed on top of Block B.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block D is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of it.
- The robot hand is empty.

The environment consists of four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot hand are critical for planning further actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and each block is interacting with others or placed on a table in various ways. Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted a mistake in attempting to unstack block B from block C when block B was actually on top of block D, and block D was on block B. This mistake underscores the importance of correctly understanding the stack relationships and the clear statuses of each block before attempting any move. The valid action was to unstack block D from block B, which indicates that block D was not properly positioned for the goal state yet.

Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that attempting to pick up block B was invalid due to its current state in the stack with other blocks. The valid actions were to pick up block D, which was clear, or to unstack block B from block C, indicating that block B was not freely accessible and was still involved in a stack configuration. This underlines the importance of accurately tracking the status of each block in terms of clearness and engagement in stacks.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(c:default,b:default) - Remove block C from block B.
2. put-down(c:default) - Place block C on the table.
3. unstack(b:default,d:default) - Remove block B from block D.
4. put-down(b:default) - Place block B on the table.

9. unstack(d:default,b:default) - Remove block D from block B.
10. put-down(d:default) - Place block D on the table.
11. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up block B.
12. stack(b:default,c:default) - Stack block B on block C.
13. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up block D.
14. stack(d:default,b:default) - Stack block D on block B.
15. unstack(d:default,b:default) - Remove block D from block B again.
16. put-down(d:default) - Place block D on the table.
17. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up block B.
18. stack(b:default,c:default) - Stack block B on block C once more.
19. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up block D.
20. stack(d:default,b:default) - Stack block D on block B.
21. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up block A, which should now be clear.
22. stack(a:default,d:default) - Stack block A on block D, achieving the goal state configuration.

This revised sequence ensures that each action respects the current state of the blocks, with careful consideration given to which blocks are clear for manipulation. This approach should meet the environment's requirements and progress towards the goal configuration.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback reveals that the action 'pick-up(b:default)' was invalid because block B was not clear, indicated by valid actions being 'unstack(c:default,a:default)', which suggests block C was on top of block A. This mistake underscores the importance of closely monitoring and understanding the configuration of blocks before attempting any action, ensuring the action corresponds to the actual state of the blocks.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(b:default)' at index 12 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,b:default):
In the current scenario, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block a is directly on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is positioned on top of block d and is also clear with no other blocks on top of it.
- Block d is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup forms the environment in which actions such as moving blocks and repositioning them through stacking or unstacking will occur.
put-down(c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's a summary of the current state:

- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear and is on the table.
- Block B is also clear.
- The robot's hand is empty.
- Block C is clear and is on the table.
- Block D is on the table.

This setup indicates that the blocks are positioned with B on D, while blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table. All blocks except D are clear, meaning they have no other blocks on top of them, and the robot hand is not holding any blocks.
unstack(b:default,d:default):
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are positioned on the table. Each of these blocks, A, C, and D, is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them, allowing for potential manipulation or movement.
put-down(b:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, all blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on top of them. Each of these blocks is placed directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed, given that all are accessible and the robot's hand is ready to perform actions.

Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlights a fundamental error in attempting to pick up block B when it was not clear. The valid actions available were 'pick-up(c:default)' and 'unstack(a:default,d:default)', indicating that block B was still under block C or in a position where it was not directly accessible.

Error Feedback: The action '1.unstack(c:default,b:default)-UnstackblockCfromblockB.' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)

States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and each block is interacting with others or placed on a table in various ways. Specifically, block a is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block d is also on the table. Block b has block c on top of it, and block c, in turn, is clear. Block b is on top of block d. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup of blocks and conditions must be considered when planning movements or rearrangements in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.

Reflect: The error feedback indicates an issue with the formatting of the action sequence provided, where an unnecessary description was included. The valid actions at the starting state were correctly identified as 'pick-up(a:default)' and 'unstack(c:default,b:default)', but the format of the action sequence should strictly follow the expected commands without additional text.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(a:default,d:default)' at index 3 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(a:default)
- stack(a:default,b:default)
- stack(a:default,c:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,b:default):
In the current scenario, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the arrangement and status of each:

- Block a is directly on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is positioned on top of block d and is also clear with no other blocks on top of it.
- Block d is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c.

This setup forms the environment in which actions such as moving blocks and repositioning them through stacking or unstacking will occur.
put-down(c:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's a summary of the current state:

- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block A is clear and is on the table.
- Block B is also clear.
- The robot's hand is empty.
- Block C is clear and is on the table.
- Block D is on the table.

This setup indicates that the blocks are positioned with B on D, while blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table. All blocks except D are clear, meaning they have no other blocks on top of them, and the robot hand is not holding any blocks.
pick-up(a:default):
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks or items: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The scenario is set up as follows:

- Block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd'.
- Both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- Blocks 'd' and 'c' are placed directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently holding block 'a'.

This setup is part of a blocksworld domain where the objective typically involves reconfiguring these blocks into a new specified arrangement using a series of actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.

Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of actions that involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks by a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the action 'stack(a:default,d:default)' was invalid because block A could not be stacked on block D at that state. The valid actions were 'put-down(a:default)', 'stack(a:default,b:default)', and 'stack(a:default,c:default)', suggesting block A was free to be placed on blocks B or C but not D. This error highlights the importance of considering the actual available actions and the current configuration of blocks before attempting a maneuver.

Action Sequence:
1. unstack(c:default,b:default) - Remove block C from block B.
2. put-down(c:default) - Place block C on the table.
3. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up block A from the table.
4. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stack block A on block B.
5. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up block D from the table.
6. stack(d:default,c:default) - Stack block D on block C.
7. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up block B (with A on top).
8. stack(b:default,a:default) - Correcting sequence: Stack block B on block A.
9. unstack(a:default,b:default) - Unstack block A from block B.
10. stack(a:default,d:default) - Stack block A on block D, now that block D is on the table and clear.
