ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here's a summary of the situation:

1. Block B is placed on top of Block D.
2. Block A is positioned directly on the table and it's clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
3. Block B is also clear.
4. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.
5. Block C, like Block A, is on the table and clear.
6. Block D is also on the table.

This configuration provides a clear layout where two blocks (A and C) are on the table with nothing on them, Block B is clear and on top of Block D, while Block D itself is on the table with Block B on top. The robot hand is available to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks since it's empty.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block D placed directly on top of block C. This configuration needs to be achieved by appropriately manipulating the blocks using the available actions (pick-up, put-down, stack, and unstack) and considering the current state of the blocks, the table, and the robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first attempt at generating an action sequence, there is no previous feedback to reflect upon. The initial state shows that the robot's hand is empty, and it can perform pick-ups on blocks A and C or unstack block B from D. The goal requires block D to be on top of block C, which is currently clear and on the table.

Think: 
To achieve the goal of having block D on top of block C, I need to ensure that block D is clear to be moved. Since block B is currently on top of D, the first action should be to unstack B from D. After unstacking, the robot will be holding block B, necessitating a put-down action for B to free the robot's hand. Then, the robot can pick up block D and stack it on block C. The final configuration should have block D directly on top of block C.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
