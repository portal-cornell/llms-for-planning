ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c. The current configuration and status of these blocks and the robot's hand are as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block a is placed on top of block b.
- Block c is also on the table.
- Both blocks a and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty and not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates that the robot can interact with blocks a and c directly due to their clear status, and it's possible to perform actions such as picking up these blocks since the hand is empty.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block B, and block B is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current starting state, the robot's hand is empty, and the goal state requires a specific stacking order of the blocks. The actions allowed are to pick up block c or unstack block a from b. Since block a is already correctly positioned on b for the goal state, the primary task is to position block b on c.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the robot should first get block b free to be placed on block c. This involves unstacking block a from b, then picking up block b (once block a is put down and free), and finally stacking block b on c. Once block b is on c, block a must be re-stacked on block b.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
