ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment setup of the Blocksworld, the following conditions are observed:

1. Block 'a' is placed directly on the table.
2. Block 'b' is clear of any other blocks on top of it and is stacked on top of block 'c'.
3. Block 'c' is positioned directly on top of block 'a'.
4. Block 'd' is on the table and is clear of any blocks on top of it.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

The objects present in this scenario are four blocks labeled 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Each block is positioned as described, either on the table or on top of another block, with some blocks being clear, indicating they can be interacted with or moved by the robot.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the start of a new problem-solving session, there is no previous error feedback to reflect on. The setup involves a clear understanding of the current positions of blocks and what actions are possible from the starting state. The goal state requires stack manipulation.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B, the following steps can be considered:
1. Block B is already on top of block C, so no action is needed for this arrangement.
2. Block D needs to be stacked on top of block B. To do this, block D, which is clear and on the table, should be picked up.
3. After picking up block D, it should be stacked on top of block B.

Action Sequence: pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)
