ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block B is currently on top of Block D. Both Blocks A and C are positioned on the table. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks at the moment. Furthermore, Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them, while Block D has Block B on top. This setup allows for potential movements such as moving Block B from Block D or manipulating Blocks A and C since they are clear and accessible.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block A, and block C is on block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks in the order of D, C, A, and B from bottom to top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
This is the initial attempt at creating an action sequence for this configuration, so there are no previous errors to reflect upon. The starting state involves blocks A, B, C, and D with specific clear conditions and positions. The goal is a specific stacking order.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state of D, C, A, B (from bottom to top), I need to consider the current positions and clear statuses:
1. Block B must first be moved from its current position on D to allow manipulation of Block D.
2. Block C must be stacked on Block D.
3. Block A must then be stacked on Block C.
4. Finally, Block B should be stacked on Block A.

Given the valid actions from the starting state, I can start with unstacking B from D, because this aligns with the necessity to clear D for further stacking and also frees up B for the final placement.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
