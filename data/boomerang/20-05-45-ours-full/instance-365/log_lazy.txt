ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The situation is as follows:

- Block d is on top of block c.
- Blocks a, b, and c are each on the table.
- All blocks a, b, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand within the Blocksworld domain.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the ultimate objective is to have block B positioned on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first interaction, there's no previous action sequence or error feedback to reflect upon. The goal is clear: stack block b on top of block c.

Think: To achieve the goal from the starting state:
1. Block b is clear and on the table, making it ready to be picked up.
2. Block c is clear and on the table but has block d on top, so block d needs to be moved first to make space for block b.
3. The robot's hand is empty, ideal for picking up block d.
4. After picking up block d, it should be placed down on the table.
5. Then, pick up block b and stack it on block c.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)
