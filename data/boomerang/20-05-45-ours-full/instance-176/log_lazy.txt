ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the summary of the setup based on the provided predicates:

1. Block B is clear, meaning no other block is placed on top of it.
2. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
3. Block B is placed on top of Block C.
4. Block D is directly on the table.
5. Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
6. Block A is stacked on top of Block D.

This configuration shows a vertical arrangement where Block D serves as the base on the table, followed by Block A, then Block C, and finally Block B on top.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, there are multiple blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on the table or stacked on top of each other. Each block that is not covered by another block is considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold one block or be empty. The ultimate goal in this scenario is to stack block C on top of block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial sequence proposal with no previous actions or error feedback, I will proceed based on the starting state and the valid actions provided. The goal is to stack block C on top of block B.

Think: The current state has block B clear and on top of block C, and the valid action available is to unstack block B from block C. To reach the goal state where block C is stacked on block B, block B needs to be clear and block C must also be clear to execute the stack action. Therefore, the first step is to unstack block B from block C and then proceed to manipulate the blocks to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)
