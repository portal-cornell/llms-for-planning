ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Here is the current configuration and status of each component:

1. Block B is on the table.
2. Block A is stacked on top of Block B.
3. The robot's hand is empty.
4. Block C is clear and also on the table.
5. Block A is also clear.

This setup indicates that both Block A and Block C have no other blocks on top of them, allowing movement or stacking actions to be performed with them. The robot's hand being empty means it is ready to pick up a block that is clear.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block 'a' is placed on top of block 'c', and block 'b' is stacked on top of block 'a'. This setup requires the blocks to be manipulated into a vertical stack with 'c' at the base, followed by 'a', and 'b' on the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The starting state has Block A on top of Block B and Block C is clear. The goal state requires Block A on top of Block C and Block B on top of Block A. The robot's hand is empty, meaning it can pick up or unstack any clear block.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the sequence of actions should involve manipulating the blocks to form the required stack. First, I need to make Block A available to place on Block C by unstacking it from Block B. Then, pick up Block A (now clear) and stack it on Block C. Finally, pick up Block B and stack it on Block A. This sequence avoids unnecessary moves and directly aims to form the desired configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 6
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
