ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The setup of the blocks is as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is stacked on top of block a.
- Block c is stacked on top of block b.
- Block d is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. The above arrangement indicates that blocks a and b are not clear because they have other blocks stacked on them, while blocks c and d are clear, with c being part of a stack and d being directly on the table.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, there are various blocks and a table, with a robot that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can either be on other blocks or on the table. Blocks that are not covered by other blocks are considered clear. The robot's hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The ultimate objective in this scenario is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
There is no error feedback from previous steps, as this is the first attempt to create an action sequence. The initial state has block a on the table with b and c stacked on it, and block d clear on the table. The goal is to have block a on top of block d. The robot's hand is empty, which allows for picking up clear blocks or unstacking blocks from the top.

Think:
To achieve the goal of having block a on top of block d, the sequence should first clear the way to access block a. This involves unstacking block c from b and then unstacking block b from a. After block a is clear, the robot can pick up block a and stack it on block d. The robot's hand starts empty, so the sequence begins by manipulating the topmost clear blocks.

Action Sequence:
unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
