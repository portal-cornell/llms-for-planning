ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: A, B, C, and D. Hereâ€™s the current configuration of these blocks and the robot's state:

1. Blocks A, B, and C are placed directly on the table.
2. Block D is stacked on top of Block A.
3. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
4. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.

This setup forms the initial state of the blocks and the robot in the environment. The goal is to manipulate these blocks to achieve a desired configuration, using actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks while considering the state of the robot's hand.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the objective is to rearrange the blocks such that block B is positioned on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial interaction, there is no past reflection or error feedback to consider. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that B is on C and C is on A, with all of them being on the table. The robot's hand is currently empty, and the valid actions are to pick up B, pick up C, or unstack D from A.

Think: The first step should involve making block A available to have C stacked on it. Since block D is currently on A, the first action should be to unstack D from A. After D is unstacked and in the robot's hand, the next logical step is to put it down on the table, making it clear and keeping the robot's hand empty for further actions. Next, C should be picked up and then stacked on A. Finally, B should be picked up and stacked on C to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]

Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
