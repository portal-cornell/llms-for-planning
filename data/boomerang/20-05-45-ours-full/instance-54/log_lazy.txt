ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration and status of each:

- Block D is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks A, B, and C are directly on the table.
- Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to pick up or manipulate blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to achieve a specific configuration of blocks. The objective is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration requires careful manipulation of the blocks using actions like stacking or unstacking to reach the desired state.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first proposed action sequence, there is no prior error feedback or sequence to reflect on. My initial strategy will involve analyzing the starting and goal states to determine the most efficient and valid sequence of actions to rearrange the blocks as required.

Think: The goal is to have A on C, C on B, and D on A. Currently, D is on C, and A, B, and C are clear except for D on C. The sequence should first clear C by moving D, then stack C on B, followed by stacking A on C, and finally D on A.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
