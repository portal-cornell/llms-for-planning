ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block b is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is empty and not holding any blocks.
- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block d is on the table.
- Block c is also on the table.
- Block a is on top of block d and is clear.

This setup indicates that blocks a and b are clear and can be moved by the robot hand. Blocks c and d are directly on the table, forming the base for blocks b and a respectively. The robot hand being empty suggests it is ready to pick up any clear block.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block D, block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B, effectively forming a stack C-B-A-D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
As this is the first proposed sequence of actions, there is no previous error feedback or states visited to reflect on. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a stack from the bottom up: D, A, B, C. Given that the robot hand is empty and the valid actions are to unstack blocks A from D and B from C, the initial moves will involve using these actions to clear the blocks for re-stacking.

Think:
The current setup requires rearranging blocks for the desired stack order of C-B-A-D. Blocks A and B are clear and can be moved. The sequence should start by creating a clear path to re-stack the blocks:
1. Unstack block B from block C (B is clear and can be moved).
2. Put down block B on the table (clearing the hand).
3. Unstack block A from block D (A is clear and can be moved).
4. Stack block A on block D (since the goal is to get A back on D but with B on top eventually).
5. Pick up block B from the table (which was placed down earlier).
6. Stack block B on block A (aligning with the goal state configuration).
7. Pick up block C and place it on block B to complete the stack C-B-A-D.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]
