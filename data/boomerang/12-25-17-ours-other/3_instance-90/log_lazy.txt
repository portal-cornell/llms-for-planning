ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, all three blocks are placed on the table. Each block ('a', 'b', and 'c') is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks at the moment. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as picking up any of the blocks since they are all accessible and the hand is free to operate.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
Goal State:
The objective in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block A. This setup involves moving and stacking the blocks in a specific order using the robot hand, ensuring that the final configuration meets these conditions.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the initial attempt at solving the puzzle, there are no prior errors or reflections to learn from. The goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific order: block B on top of block C, and block C on top of block A. All blocks are currently clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty.

Think: The robot hand is currently empty, which means the first valid action is to pick up a block. To achieve the goal state, the robot should first pick up block C (since it will be at the base of the stack), then put it down on block A, and finally stack block B on top of block C. This sequence of actions will build the stack in the desired order.

Action Sequence: pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
