ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. All these blocks are placed directly on the table. Furthermore, the tops of all three blocks—A, B, and C—are clear, indicating that there are no other blocks stacked on them. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, and block B is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given that the initial state has all blocks on the table and the robot's hand is empty, the actions available are limited to picking up any of the blocks A, B, or C. The goal is to have block B on top of block A, and block A on top of block C. This requires stacking operations after picking up the blocks.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the robot needs to pick up block A, place it on block C, then pick up block B and place it on block A. The sequence involves a combination of pick-up, stack, and potentially unstack actions, depending on the sequence. The first task is to get block A on top of block C, so picking up block A and stacking it on block C would be fundamental. Following this, picking up block B and stacking it on block A will achieve the desired configuration.

Action Sequence: pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
