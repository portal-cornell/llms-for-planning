ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Currently:
- Block b is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block d is similarly on the table and clear.
- Block c is also on the table but supports block a on top of it, making block a clear.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

These details set the stage for actions involving picking up, stacking, and unstacking blocks as needed to achieve a desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocks World environment, the primary objective is to arrange block d on top of block b. The environment includes a robot hand capable of manipulating the blocks, a set of blocks, and a table. The blocks can be positioned on top of each other or placed directly on the table. Additionally, any block that isn't covered by another block is considered clear. The robot hand itself can either hold a block or be empty at any given time. The solution involves the robot using actions to move the blocks around to achieve the goal of stacking block d on block b.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Given that this is the first attempt to create an action sequence, there is no error feedback to reflect on. The current understanding is that the robot can either pick up clear blocks or unstack one block from another. The valid actions available include picking up blocks b and d, and unstacking block a from block c.

Think:
The goal is to stack block d on top of block b. Initially, blocks b and d are both clear and on the table, and the robot's hand is empty. To achieve the goal, the robot should:
1. Pick up block d, as it needs to be placed on block b.
2. Then, stack block d onto block b.

Action Sequence: pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
