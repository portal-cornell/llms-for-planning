ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The blocks are arranged as follows: Block a and block b are placed directly on the table. Block c is stacked on top of block b, and block d is stacked on top of block a. Both blocks c and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform operations such as picking up or moving blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block A is on top of block C, and block C is directly on top of block D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial attempt at solving the puzzle, there's no prior error feedback or visited states to reflect on. The goal is to reposition blocks to meet the specified configuration where block A is on top of block C, which in turn is on top of block D.

Think: To achieve the goal, the following steps seem logical:
1. Start by unstacking block D from block A, as block D needs to be on the table to eventually support block C.
2. Then, unstack block C from block B as block C needs to be moved on top of block D.
3. Put down block D onto the table.
4. Pick up block A and stack it on block C (after block C is placed on block D).
5. Finally, stack block C on block D.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)
