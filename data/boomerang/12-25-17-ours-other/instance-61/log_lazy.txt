ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and C are all placed on the table.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This setup represents the initial state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the Blocksworld domain.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A. This setup involves modifying the current configuration of blocks to achieve this specific stacking order.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There are no prior actions or errors to reflect on since this is the first sequence of actions proposed. The starting state shows blocks A, B, and C on the table, with block D on top of B. The goal is to have block C on top of block A, and block A on top of block D. This requires a series of moves using the valid actions provided.

Think: To achieve the goal, we need to clear the path for stacking block A on top of block D and then stack block C on block A. First, block D needs to be removed from block B. After that, block A can be picked up and placed on top of block D once the robot's hand is free. Finally, block C can be picked up and stacked on block A.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
