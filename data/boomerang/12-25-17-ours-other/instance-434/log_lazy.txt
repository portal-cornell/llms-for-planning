ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each block is placed as follows: Block A is on top of Block C, while Blocks B, C, and D are each on the table. All the blocks A, B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it's not holding any block at the moment. This setup forms the initial state of the environment in the Blocksworld domain.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block A and block D is on top of block C. This configuration requires the blocks to be stacked in a specific order to achieve the desired structure.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial attempt at constructing a sequence of actions, I will propose a series of moves that I believe will transition the blocks from the starting state to the goal state. The starting state has blocks A, B, C, and D clear and on the table, except for A, which is on C. The robot's hand is empty. The goal state requires C on A and D on C, which implies a restructuring of the current block arrangement.

Think: To achieve the goal state, I need to:
1. Free block C by moving block A from on top of it.
2. Stack block C on block A.
3. Stack block D on block C.

Given the constraints and the actions allowed, I'll need to unstack A from C, then pick up C and stack it on A, and finally pick up D and stack it on C.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
