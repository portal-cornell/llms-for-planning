ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks named A, B, and C. Block A is clear and positioned on the table. Block B is also clear and is placed on top of Block C. Block C is located directly on the table. The robot's hand is currently empty. This setup allows for various actions to be performed, such as moving the blocks around to achieve a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block C stacked on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first action sequence, there's no prior error feedback or action history to reflect upon. All actions need to be planned from the current configuration of blocks: A and C on the table with B on top of C, and the robot's hand empty.

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block A. Currently, B is on top of C, so C is not clear. The first step should be to make block C clear by moving block B. Since B is on C, the valid action is to unstack B from C. After unstacking B, the robot's hand will be holding B, and both A and C will be clear, allowing further manipulation. The next step should be to put down B onto the table to free the robot's hand. Following this, the robot can pick up C and stack it on A.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
