ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block A is directly on the table.

Additionally, Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it's not currently holding any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, we have a scenario involving a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed on other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The current goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block C is on block B, and block D is on block C. This configuration requires a sequence of actions, possibly involving picking up, stacking, unstacking, and putting down blocks to achieve the desired stack order from the table or existing stacks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first set of instructions, there is no prior feedback to reflect upon. We are starting with the initial configuration of blocks and our goal is to rearrange them to meet the specified goal state.

Think: To reach the goal state where Block C is on Block B, and Block D is on Block C, we must first clear any blocks that are not in their desired positions and then strategically stack them. Initially, Block D is on Block B which is incorrect according to the goal state. Block C is on Block A but should be on Block B. Hence, we need to:
1. Unstack Block D from Block B.
2. Temporarily place Block D on the table.
3. Unstack Block B from Block C.
4. Place Block B on the table.
5. Unstack Block C from Block A.
6. Stack Block C on Block B.
7. Pick up Block D from the table.
8. Stack Block D on Block C.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(c:default,a:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(c:default,a:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
