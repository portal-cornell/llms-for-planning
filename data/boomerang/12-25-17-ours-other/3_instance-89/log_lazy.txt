ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled A, B, and C. Each of these blocks is positioned on the table and has no other blocks on top of them, making them clear. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty and not holding any blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block A. This setup involves various objects including blocks (like A and B), a table, and a robot hand. The robot can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, stacking them, unstacking them from each other, or putting them down on the table. The ultimate objective is to achieve the configuration where block B is directly above block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the first plan being formulated for reaching the goal state, I will base my approach on the given starting and goal states, without any prior error feedback to reflect upon.

Think: The goal is to have block B on top of block A. Starting with all blocks clear and on the table, the robot hand empty, the first step should be to pick up block B, since B needs to be placed on A. After picking up B, block A should be clear for B to be placed on it. Thus, the next action should be to stack B on A.

Action Sequence: pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
