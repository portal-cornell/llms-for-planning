ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described scenario, we have three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Block 'b' is positioned on the table. Block 'a' is stacked on top of block 'b' and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block 'a'. Block 'c' is also on the table and is clear. The robot's hand is currently empty. This setup suggests a scenario where block stacking and movement can occur without immediate restraints from other blocks or the robot's hand being occupied.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this scenario, the environment consists of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be positioned either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block that has no other blocks on top of it is considered clear. The robot hand has the capability to either hold one block at a time or to be empty.

The goal in this particular situation is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'a'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first action sequence and no previous sequences or errors have been provided, I will base my decision solely on the current state and goal. The goal is to have block 'b' on top of block 'a'. Currently, 'a' is on top of 'b', and the robot's hand is empty.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state, I must rearrange the blocks. Firstly, I need to clear block 'a' from on top of 'b', as it needs to be underneath 'b' in the goal state. Since 'a' is already clear and on top of 'b', I can directly unstack 'a' from 'b'. After unstacking 'a', I will have 'a' in the robot's hand, and I can then put it down on the table. This action will free up block 'b' to be manipulated. Finally, I can pick up 'b' and stack it on top of 'a', which will be on the table.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)
