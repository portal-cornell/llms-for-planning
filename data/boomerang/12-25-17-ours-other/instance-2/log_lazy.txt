ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration of the blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block B is on the table.
2. Block A is on top of Block B, and Block A is clear.
3. Block C is on the table.
4. Block D is on top of Block C, and Block D is clear.
5. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.

This setup involves each block either directly on the table or stacked on another block, with the top blocks (A and D) being clear and available for manipulation by the robot hand. The objective in this scenario typically involves rearranging these blocks to achieve a specific configuration, utilizing the robot's actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the objective is to arrange block C on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first attempt at creating an action sequence, there is no prior error feedback or reflection to consider. I will start fresh and focus on forming a plan to achieve the goal state.

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block A. Initially, block A is on top of B and block D is on top of C. The robot hand is empty, which allows it to manipulate blocks. Here's the thought process:
1. I need block A to be clear to stack C on it. Block A is already clear.
2. Block C is not clear because D is on top of it, so I need to move D first.
3. Once block D is removed, I can pick up C.
4. Since block A is clear and already on top of B, I can directly stack C on A.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
