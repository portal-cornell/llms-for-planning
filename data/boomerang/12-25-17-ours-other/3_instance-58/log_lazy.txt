ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as "a", "b", and "c". The configuration of these blocks and conditions are as follows:
- Block "a" is on the table.
- Block "b" is positioned on top of block "a" and is clear, which means no block is on top of "b".
- Block "c" is on the table and is also clear.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating that it is not holding any blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block C placed on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first interaction, there's no prior error feedback or states visited to reflect upon. The current state shows that block "b" is on "a", and block "c" is clear on the table. The goal is to stack block "c" on block "a". 

Think: To achieve the goal state, the hand must first be free to pick up block "c". Since block "b" is currently on block "a" and the robot's hand is empty, the first action should be to unstack block "b" from "a". This will make block "a" clear, allowing block "c" to be moved onto it. After unstacking "b", the next action should be to pick up block "c" from the table. Finally, block "c" should be stacked on block "a".

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(c:default)' at index 1 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,a:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)

States Visited:
unstack(b:default,a:default):
In the given BlocksWorld environment, there are three blocks labeled as "a", "b", and "c". Currently, block "a" is positioned on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear. Block "b" is being held by the robot's hand. Block "c" is also on the table and is clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of it.

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as "a", "b", and "c". The configuration of these blocks and conditions are as follows:
- Block "a" is on the table.
- Block "b" is positioned on top of block "a" and is clear, which means no block is on top of "b".
- Block "c" is on the table and is also clear.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating that it is not holding any blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to have block C placed on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous action plan failed because the action 'pick-up(c:default)' was invalid after unstacking block "b" from "a". The error occurred because the robot's hand was not emptyâ€”it was holding block "b". The valid actions at that point were to put down block "b" or stack it on another block.

Think: To reach the goal state where block "c" is on block "a", the sequence must consider that the robot's hand is occupied after the 'unstack(b:default,a:default)' action. The robot must first put down block "b" before picking up block "c". 

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)
