ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current arrangement and status of these objects:

- Block A is placed on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is also on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block D.

Both Block B and Block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block D and block B is on top of block C. This configuration needs to be achieved by manipulating the blocks using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking with the aid of a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Given the initial state and the goal state, I need to carefully plan the sequence of actions ensuring each action is valid and leads towards the goal configuration. I have two valid actions available: unstack B from D and unstack C from A. Since these are the only actions listed as valid, I must execute these first before any other actions become available.

Think: 
To reach the goal state, where A is on D and B is on C, I need to first free up A and D. This involves unstacking C from A and B from D. After unstacking, I will be able to rearrange them as needed. Considering the robot hand can only hold one block at a time, I should plan the pickups and put-downs accordingly.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
