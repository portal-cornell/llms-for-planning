ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. These blocks are either positioned on the table or stacked on top of each other. Specifically:

- Block a is on the table and is clear of any other blocks.
- Block b is also on the table and is clear.
- Block c is on the table and is clear.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a and is clear.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or moving blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block C is placed on top of block D and block D is placed on top of block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial setup and no actions have been taken yet, there is no error feedback or previous actions to reflect on. The goal is to arrange block C on top of block D, and block D on top of block B. The robot hand is empty, which allows it to perform pick-up or unstack actions.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the first step is to make block D accessible to be moved onto block B. Currently, block D is stacked on block A, so it needs to be unstacked first. After unstacking D from A, D can be stacked onto B. Finally, block C can be picked up from the table and stacked onto D.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
