ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current Blocks World environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Here is the configuration of these blocks and other conditions:

- Block A and Block B are both placed directly on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block C is also clear, indicating that nothing is on top of it.
- The robot's hand is empty, meaning it is not holding any of the blocks.

This setup is essential for planning the next steps, possibly to rearrange the blocks to achieve a specific configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the objective is to arrange block A on top of block B. This environment includes several blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The blocks can be placed either on the table or on top of other blocks. A block must be clear (with no other blocks on top of it) to be moved. The robot hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The goal here specifically requires block A to be directly on top of block B in the final configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback, indicating that no previous action sequences have been tried yet. The initial state consists of block C on top of block A, and block B is clear with the robot hand empty. The goal is to have block A on top of block B.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is stacked on block B:
1. Block C must be removed from atop block A to make block A movable.
2. Block A must then be picked up and placed on top of block B.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)
