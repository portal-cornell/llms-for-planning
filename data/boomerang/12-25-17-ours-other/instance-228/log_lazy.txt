ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration is as follows: 
- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is stacked on top of block a.
- Block b is stacked on top of block d.
- Block d is also on the table. 

Both blocks b and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup provides a clear picture of the starting state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the Blocksworld domain.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block C on top of block D. This setup involves various blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The robot can perform actions such as picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on another, and unstacking a block from another. The main objective is to reconfigure the blocks so that block C is positioned directly above block D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the initial setup of the blocks, we must find a way to get block c on top of block d. The valid actions allow us to unstack block c from block a and block b from block d. This matches the available actions for the blocks that are clear and the hand that is empty.

Think: To reach the goal state where block c is on top of block d, we need to:
1. Unstack block c from block a.
2. Put down block c on the table as the robot hand can hold only one block.
3. Unstack block b from block d.
4. Put down block b on the table.
5. Pick up block c from the table.
6. Stack block c on block d.

This sequence respects the constraints of the robot hand and the rules of stacking and unstacking.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default)
