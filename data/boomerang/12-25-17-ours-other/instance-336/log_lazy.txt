ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A is on top of block D, both block B and block D are directly on the table, and block C is also on the table. Blocks B, A, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to rearrange blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block C is directly on block D. This setup is part of a scenario where blocks are manipulated to achieve specific configurations using a robot hand that can pick up, put down, stack, and unstack blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the first action sequence, there is no previous feedback or states to reflect upon. The starting state and the goal state are clearly defined.

Think: The goal is to have block A on block C, and block C on block D. Currently, block A is on block D, and both blocks B and C are clear on the table. The robot hand is empty. A possible sequence to achieve the goal state would involve:
1. Unstacking block A from block D.
2. Putting down block A on the table.
3. Picking up block C.
4. Stacking block C on block D.
5. Picking up block A.
6. Stacking block A on block C.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,d:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,d:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "unstack(a:default,b:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)"]
