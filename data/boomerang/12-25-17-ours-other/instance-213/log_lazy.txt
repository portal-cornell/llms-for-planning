ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as blocks a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block d is on top of block b.
- Block c is on top of block a.
- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block a is directly on the table.

Additionally, block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it, and the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup provides a clear overview of the state of blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block A, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C, effectively forming a vertical stack from A to D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the first sequence of actions to be proposed, there is no prior error feedback to reflect on. The initial state shows that blocks are not in the desired configuration, and since the robot's hand is empty, the valid action to start with involves unstacking block d from block b.

Think: To reach the goal state where B is on top of A, C is on top of B, and D is on top of C, we need to rearrange the blocks. The current valid action is unstacking d from b. After this, the robot will be holding d, and we need to plan the next steps to eventually stack the blocks in the required order:
1. Unstack block d from b (robot holds d)
2. Put down block d on the table (clears robot's hand and makes block d accessible)
3. Unstack block b from c (robot holds b)
4. Stack block b on a (as per goal state configuration)
5. Unstack block c from a (robot holds c)
6. Stack block c on b (continuing to meet the goal state configuration)
7. Pick up block d from the table (robot holds d)
8. Stack block d on c to complete the desired order.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), stack(b:default,a:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(b:default,a:default)' at index 3 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)

States Visited:
unstack(d:default,b:default):
In the environment described, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, and possibly a table and a robot hand. Currently, block c is on top of block a, and block b is on top of block c. Block a is directly on the table. Block d is being held by the robot hand. Additionally, block b is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The robot hand is occupied and thus cannot pick up another block until it releases block d.
put-down(d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d, and a table. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block d is clear and on the table.
- Block b is also clear and is on top of block c.
- Block c is on top of block a.
- Block a is on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks a and d are directly on the table, block c is stacked on block a, and block b is stacked on block c. The robot hand is not holding any blocks at the moment.
unstack(b:default,c:default):
In the described environment, there are four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block d is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it (clear).
- Block b is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block c is placed on top of block a and has no blocks on top, making it clear.
- Block a is on the table. 

This setup indicates that block d and block a are directly on the table, block c is stacked on block a, block b is in the robot's hand, and both blocks c and d are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as blocks a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block d is on top of block b.
- Block c is on top of block a.
- Block b is on top of block c.
- Block a is directly on the table.

Additionally, block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it, and the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks. This setup provides a clear overview of the state of blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block A, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C, effectively forming a vertical stack from A to D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the action 'stack(b:default,a:default)' was invalid because block a was not clear at the moment when the action was proposed. The valid actions available were to place block b directly on the table or stack it on top of blocks c or d. It's important to note the state of other blocks and ensure the target block is clear before attempting to stack another block on top of it.

Think: Considering the current valid actions and the error feedback, a revised plan should account for the state of block a (i.e., it being occupied by block c). Therefore, before stacking b on a, block c must be moved. The plan should include placing b on the table temporarily after handling d, then rearranging c and finally stacking b on a.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)
