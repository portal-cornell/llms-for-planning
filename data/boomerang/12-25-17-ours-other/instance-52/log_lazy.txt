ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's a summary of their current arrangement and status:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is also on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block B.

Additionally:
- Block C and Block D are clear, meaning there's nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup suggests the blocks are arranged in two separate stacks with potential for the robot to interact with Blocks C and D or move other blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. The robot hand will need to execute a sequence of movements to achieve this specific configuration of blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first iteration, no previous errors or feedback need to be reflected upon. This is an opportunity to plan an efficient sequence of actions to reach the goal state based on the current configuration. The goal is to have a stack where C is on A, and A is on B. The current state with C on A is already halfway there; the focus should be on correctly stacking A on B.

Think: 
The current state has C on A and D on B, with both C and D clear. The robot's hand is empty. The first step should be to free up A and B, as they are needed to form the base of the final stack configuration. This involves moving C and D from their current positions. After they are moved, A can be placed on B, and then C can be stacked on A to achieve the goal state.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,a:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
