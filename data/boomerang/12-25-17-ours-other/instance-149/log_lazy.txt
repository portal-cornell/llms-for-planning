ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, which includes blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, the configuration is as follows:

- Blocks a, b, and c are placed directly on the table.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a.
- Blocks b, c, and d have no other blocks on top of them, making them clear.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup provides a clear picture of the state of each block and the status of the robot's hand, crucial for planning the next steps in manipulating the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the first attempt at solving the problem, with no prior sequences or errors to reflect upon. The initial strategy is to understand the configuration and take actions that progressively move towards the goal.

Think: The goal is to have block B on top of block C and block D on top of block A. Starting from the current state:
1. Block D is already on top of block A, which is part of the goal state.
2. Blocks B and C are clear and on the table, so we need to stack B on C.

To achieve this, we should:
- Pick up block B, since it is clear and on the table.
- Then, stack block B on block C.

Since block D is already on block A, there is no need to move these blocks, making the action sequence quite straightforward.

Action Sequence: pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
