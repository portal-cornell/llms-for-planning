ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. Here is the current state of these blocks and the robot hand:

- Blocks a, b, and d are placed directly on the table.
- Block c is placed on top of block b.
- Blocks a, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty and not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates that the blocks are partially stacked with opportunities to rearrange them as needed, while the robot hand is available to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment involves rearranging blocks in a specific configuration where block C should be placed on top of block B, and block D should be placed on top of block A. These arrangements need to be achieved by manipulating the blocks using a set of actions that include picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking. The robot hand will assist in these tasks, aiming to move from the current configuration to this desired setup.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial attempt and there is no prior error feedback, the focus is on correctly planning actions based on the starting state and the goal state. The goal is to have block C on B, and block D on A, with C already on B in the starting state.

Think: Block C is already correctly placed on Block B, so no action is needed there. Block D needs to be placed on Block A. Since the robot hand is empty, the first action is to pick up block D. After picking up D, since block A is clear, the next action is to stack D on A.

Action Sequence: pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
