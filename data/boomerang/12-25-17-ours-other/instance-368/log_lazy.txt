ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as a, b, c, and d. Each of these objects is placed on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other objects stacked on top of any of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty. This setup indicates that all blocks are in a state ready to be manipulated, such as being picked up or having another block stacked onto them, without any prior rearrangement needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This specific configuration needs to be achieved to satisfy the goal conditions.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The starting state provides a clear situation where all blocks (a, b, c, and d) are on the table and clear, and the robot's hand is empty. The goal is to arrange blocks in a specific order where A is on C and C is on D. This means that the robot will need to pick up and stack blocks to achieve this configuration.

Think: Since the goal is to have A on C and C on D, the first action should involve manipulating block D to prepare it for supporting C. Following this, C can be picked up and stacked on D. Lastly, A can be picked up and placed on C. The sequence of actions should carefully consider the validity of each move, ensuring that each block is clear before attempting to pick it up or stack another block on top of it.

Action Sequence: pick-up(d:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)
