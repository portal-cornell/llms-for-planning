ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment setup for the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is placed directly on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of Block B.
- Block D is also placed on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of Block C.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup allows for various actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block B and block C is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial attempt, there is no previous error feedback or action sequence to reflect upon. The task is to rearrange blocks to achieve the goal state starting from the current configuration.

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is on top of block B and block C is on top of block A, the following steps are necessary:
1. First, unstack block B from block A since block A needs to be placed on top of block B.
2. Put down block B on the table.
3. Unstack block C from block D as block C will be placed on top of block A eventually.
4. Put down block C on the table.
5. Pick up block A since it needs to be placed on top of block B.
6. Stack block A on block B.
7. Pick up block C.
8. Stack block C on block A.

Action Sequence: unstack(b,a), put-down(b), unstack(c,d), put-down(c), pick-up(a), stack(a,b), pick-up(c), stack(c,a)

Error Feedback: The action 'unstack(b,a)' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The feedback indicates that there was an error in the format of the action 'unstack(b,a)', which should have been written as 'unstack(b:default,a:default)'. The error was in the formatting of the parameters, which did not match the expected environment description.

Think: My plan needs to correctly format the actions as described in the environment. The goal is to get block A on top of block B and block C on top of block A. I will start by correcting the action format and follow through with the planned sequence, ensuring all actions are valid as per the current state.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
