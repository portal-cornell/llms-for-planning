ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, block b is placed on the table, block a has block c on top of it, and block d is stacked on top of block c. Block d is clear, indicating that there are no blocks on top of it. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this scenario, the objective is to rearrange the blocks in such a way that block D is positioned on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current state and the goal, the main task is to rearrange blocks so that D is stacked on A. The robot hand is empty, which is suitable for starting actions like picking up or unstacking.

Think: To achieve the goal state of having D on A, I need to first make A clear, as it currently has C on top. This necessitates unstacking D from C, then unstacking C from A, and finally stacking D on A. These actions are valid based on the initial state and the goal.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
