ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The block 'a' is positioned on the table, and block 'b' is stacked on top of block 'a'. Block 'c' is also on the table. Both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to potentially pick up the clear blocks 'b' or 'c', or manipulate them in other ways according to the rules of the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange block 'b' on top of block 'c', and block 'c' on top of block 'a'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial action sequence attempt, there is no previous feedback to reflect upon. The goal is to rearrange blocks to achieve the specific configuration where block 'b' is on top of block 'c', and block 'c' on top of block 'a'.

Think: To reach the goal state from the starting state, the following steps are necessary:
1. Block 'c' needs to be on top of block 'a'. Currently, block 'c' is clear and on the table, and block 'a' is underneath block 'b'. Hence, block 'b' needs to be moved first.
2. Pick up block 'b' from block 'a' using the 'unstack' action.
3. Put down block 'b' on the table to clear the hand and make block 'b' accessible for the subsequent stacking.
4. Pick up block 'c' since it is clear and on the table.
5. Stack block 'c' on block 'a', which is now clear.
6. Finally, pick up block 'b' again and stack it on block 'c'.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
