ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as "a," "b," and "c." The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block "a" is clear and is placed on the table.
- Block "b" is clear and is positioned on top of block "c."
- Block "c" is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty.

This setup indicates that block "b" can be moved because it is clear, and the robot hand is available to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks. Block "a" is also free to be moved or have another block stacked on it since it is clear and on the table. Block "c" supports block "b" and cannot be moved directly unless block "b" is first removed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal for the robot is to rearrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block A. This configuration needs to be achieved by appropriately stacking the blocks using the available actions.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first interaction, there is no prior error feedback or action sequences to reflect upon. The current setup involves understanding the basic rules of the Blocksworld, where blocks can be moved one at a time either by picking them up from the table if they are clear, or unstacking them if they are on top of another block.

Think: The goal is to have block "B" on top of block "C" and block "C" on top of block "A". Initially, block "B" is already on top of block "C", but not in the correct overall order since block "C" needs to be on top of block "A". To achieve this, block "B" should be temporarily moved elsewhere (e.g., to the table), then block "C" can be picked up and stacked on block "A". Finally, block "B" can be restacked on top of block "C".

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]

Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
