ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, block B is on top of block C and both blocks B and C are clear, indicating that there is nothing on top of them. Block A is on the table and is also clear. The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks. Additionally, blocks A and C are directly on the table. This setup allows the robot to manipulate the blocks to achieve desired configurations, using actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be arranged either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A clear block is one that has no other blocks resting on it. Additionally, the robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange block 'b' on top of block 'a'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
As this is the first step, I will base my plan strictly on the initial and goal states provided, ensuring that I follow valid actions and aim to reach the goal state efficiently. The initial state shows that block B is on top of block C and both are clear, while block A is on the table and clear. The goal is to have block B on top of block A.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state where block B is on top of block A:
1. Block B must be picked up from block C, which can be done using the 'unstack' action as both blocks B and C are clear.
2. The robot's hand will then be holding block B.
3. Block B can be stacked on block A, which is directly on the table and clear, using the 'stack' action. 

This sequence should effectively transform the starting state into the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
