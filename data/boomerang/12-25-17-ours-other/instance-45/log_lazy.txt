ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with one table and a robot hand. Here's the configuration of these elements:

1. Blocks B and D are positioned on the table.
2. Block A is also on the table, and Block C is on top of Block A.
3. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them.
4. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup provides a clear view of each block's status and the robot hand's state, essential for planning moves to rearrange the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration must be achieved using a series of movements involving picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks with the help of a robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first interaction and no error feedback has been provided, the initial sequence will be based solely on the description of the environment and the goal state. The robot hand is empty, and the blocks are arranged with C on top of A, and B and D clear on the table. The goal is to have B on top of C and D on top of B.

Think: To achieve the goal state, steps should be carefully planned to avoid unnecessary movements and ensure that each block is moved into place correctly. Initially, the robot hand can only pick up clear blocks or unstack a block that is on top of another. The final configuration requires B at the base, C in the middle, and D on top. The plan should start by clearing the way to manipulate blocks B and C appropriately.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
