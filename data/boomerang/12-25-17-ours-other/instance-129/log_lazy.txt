ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is positioned on the table.
- Block b is directly on top of block a.
- Block c is directly on top of block b.
- Block d is directly on top of block c.

Additionally, the topmost block, d, is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. The robot's hand is currently empty and not holding any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D. This setup involves various blocks and a table, with the blocks being able to be stacked upon one another or placed on the table. Additionally, a robotic hand in the system can manipulate one block at a time, either holding it or placing it down. The ultimate objective in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is directly on block D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
In this initial step, there is no prior action sequence or error feedback to reflect on. I will start from the current situation and think through the steps required to reach the goal state from the starting state.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block D, I need to rearrange the blocks. Initially, blocks are stacked as A-B-C-D. The goal is A on D, which implies a possible final stack of either D-A or a configuration where D and A are in direct contact in some other way.

1. Unstack all blocks until A and D can be rearranged.
2. Since the robot's hand is empty, start by unstacking block D from block C.
3. Continue unstacking until reaching block A.
4. Rearrange blocks to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
