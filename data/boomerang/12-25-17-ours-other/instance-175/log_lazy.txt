ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block a is on the table, and block c is on top of block a. Block b is also on the table, and block d is on top of block b. Blocks c and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, there are a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered "clear" if there is no other block resting on it. Additionally, the robot's hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There are no prior actions or errors to reflect upon as this is the first sequence of actions to be proposed. The initial state involves blocks 'c' and 'd' stacked on blocks 'a' and 'b', respectively. The goal is to stack block 'a' on top of block 'b'. The robot hand is currently empty.

Think: To achieve the goal state of having block 'a' on top of block 'b', I must first clear block 'a' by removing block 'c' from above it. Then, block 'd' must be removed from block 'b' to make block 'b' clear for stacking. Once both blocks 'a' and 'b' are clear, I can proceed to stack 'a' on 'b'.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)
