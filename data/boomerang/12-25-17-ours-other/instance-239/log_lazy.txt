States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks as per its goal or further instructions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange a set of blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first attempt at proposing an action sequence, there is no previous error feedback or actions to reflect upon. We start with a clear understanding of the current state and available actions.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state where A is on B, C is on A, and D is on C, we need to carefully sequence our actions to avoid any blocks being inaccessible. Since the robot hand is empty, the first action should involve moving Block C from Block A, as C is the only block currently stacked and needs to be repositioned last in the goal sequence.

Action Sequence:
1. unstack(c:default,a:default) - This will move C from A to the hand, freeing up A for further actions.
2. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up B, as it needs to be at the bottom of the stack.
3. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stack A on top of B, which is now in hand.
4. put-down(d:default) - Place D on the table, clearing the hand for picking up C.
5. pick-up(c:default) - Pick up C from the table (since it was unstacked initially).
6. stack(c:default,a:default) - Stack C on A.
7. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up D again.
8. stack(d:default,c:default) - Finally, stack D on C, completing the sequence to reach the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(a:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial action sequence proposal was not explicitly rejected for incorrectness, but the formatting of the response likely caused the misunderstanding. The action 'unstack(c:default,a:default)' should be formatted without additional text or numbers to ensure clarity and proper processing by the system. This reflection helps in correcting the action format for resubmission.

Think: The aim is to achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. The first step is to free block A, which is currently under block C. The valid action 'unstack(c:default,a:default)' is appropriate here to move C into the robot hand. Following this, the robot can then manipulate other blocks as needed to achieve the final configuration. Correct ordering and proper formatting of actions in the sequence are crucial to avoid errors.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(c:default,a:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current state of the environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the summary of their status:

- Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block b is also on the table and clear.
- Block c is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is on the table and is clear as well.

This setup indicates that all blocks except for block c are resting on the table without any other blocks stacked on them, and the robot's hand is currently occupied with holding block c.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks as per its goal or further instructions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange a set of blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that my previous sequence included an invalid action, 'pick-up(b:default)', which was not permitted at that state. Instead, the robot hand was occupied with block C, allowing only for actions related to placing or stacking block C. This understanding is crucial for adjusting the action sequence to align with the valid actions available.

Think: Given that the robot hand holds block C, the next logical step is to use block C effectively to move towards the goal state. The goal is to have block A on top of block B, then block C on top of block A, and finally block D on top of block C. Since block C is in the hand, it should either be stacked directly if it aligns with the goal or put down temporarily to rearrange other blocks.

Action Sequence: put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous error feedback revealed a mistake in proposing to put down block C when it was already in the robot's hand, which was incorrect. Instead, valid actions involved picking up other blocks or unstacking block C from block A. This mistake highlights the importance of carefully reviewing the state of the environment and ensuring actions match the current configuration and abilities of the robot hand.

Think: Since block C is on top of block A and can be unstacked, and the robot hand is empty, the correct initial action is to unstack C from A. This will make both blocks A and C available for subsequent stacking to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(c:default,a:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: It appears there was another error in understanding the available actions after 'unstack(c:default,a:default)'. After unstacking, block C is in the robot's hand, hence options like 'pick-up(b:default)' are invalid because the robot hand is already occupied. Instead, actions should focus on using block C directly, such as stacking it or putting it down.

Think: Given that block C is in the robot's hand after the first action, the next logical step is to utilize block C directly. The goal is to stack A on B, then C on A, and finally D on C.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

This setup indicates that all blocks except for block c are resting on the table without any other blocks stacked on them, and the robot's hand is currently occupied with holding block c.
put-down(c:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is situated on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking any of the blocks.
pick-up(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Here's the status of each:

1. Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
2. Block B is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block C is on the table and it is also clear.
4. Block D is on the table and it is clear as well.

This setup indicates that the robot hand is currently occupied with holding block B, while the other three blocks are resting on the table without any blocks stacked on top of them.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks as per its goal or further instructions.
Valid Actions:

Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange a set of blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that attempting to stack block A on block B was invalid because block B was in the robot's hand. The valid actions were related to placing block B on top of another block or putting it down. This understanding is critical for adjusting the action sequence to properly utilize the block currently held by the robot.

Think: Given that block B is in the robot's hand, and all other blocks are clear on the table, the next logical step is to stack block B on block A, as the goal state requires block A to be on top of block B. After this, the robot should pick up block C, stack it on A, and then pick up and stack D on C.

Action Sequence: stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The previous attempt to stack block B on block A directly after unstacking was incorrect because the robot hand was empty and not holding block B. The error feedback consistently indicates what actions are valid at each step, which is crucial for adjusting the plan to align with the current state and capabilities of the robot hand.

Think: The goal is to rearrange the blocks such that A is on B, C is on A, and D is on C. Initially, C is on A, and both are on the table with B and D clear. Correctly sequencing the actions to efficiently reach the goal configuration is essential.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback clearly indicates that the action 'stack(a:default,b:default)' was invalid because block B was being held by the robot hand, not available to have another block stacked on top of it. The only valid stacking actions available were with block B as the base, highlighting the need to adjust the sequence again based on the robot's current state and the positions of the blocks.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback revealed that after stacking block B on block A and picking up block C, the action 'stack(c:default,a:default)' was invalid because block A was not clear, having block B on top of it. The valid actions involved potential placements for block C on block B or block D, but not on block A. This mistake underscores the importance of considering the "clear" status of blocks in planning the correct sequence of moves.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default)

- Block c is also on the table and clear.
- Block a is on the table but not clear, as block b is on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the positions of the blocks relative to each other and their status (whether another block is on top of them), as well as the status of the robot hand.
pick-up(d:default):
In the given environment, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is stacked on top of block a and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block c is also on the table and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block d.
stack(d:default,b:default):
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks and their relationship with the table and the robot's hand is as follows:

- Block A is located directly on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block B, making D the topmost block in this stack.
- Block C is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it.
  
Both Block D and Block C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup outlines the initial or current state of the blocks and their arrangement relative to the table and the robot's hand.

stack(c:default,d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is also on the table, and Block C is placed on top of Block D.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.
- Block C is clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of it.

This setup provides a clear snapshot of the placement of each block and the state of the robot's hand in the Blocksworld environment.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks as per its goal or further instructions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange a set of blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the final configuration did not meet the goal state requirements. Specifically, the arrangement of blocks did not follow the required order of A on B, C on A, and D on C. This mismatch highlights the need to carefully plan the sequence to ensure each block is placed correctly in relation to the others.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(c:default,a:default)' at index 5 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current state of the environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the summary of their status:

- Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block b is also on the table and clear.
- Block c is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is on the table and is clear as well.

This setup indicates that all blocks except for block c are resting on the table without any other blocks stacked on them, and the robot's hand is currently occupied with holding block c.

- Block c is also on the table and clear.
- Block a is on the table but not clear, as block b is on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the positions of the blocks relative to each other and their status (whether another block is on top of them), as well as the status of the robot hand.
pick-up(c:default):
In the environment, there are four objects named a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration:

- Block b is on top of block a.
- Block d is clear and placed on the table.
- Block c is being held by the robot hand.
- Block b is also clear.
- Block a is on the table.

This summary captures the positions and statuses of all blocks, which is crucial for planning the robot's next actions in the Blocksworld scenario.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange a set of blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback again points to an invalid action attempt to stack block C on top of block A, which was not feasible due to block A already being occupied by block B. This oversight in the sequence underlines the need to carefully observe the current status of blocks and adjust the action plan accordingly.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default)

This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The sequence of actions did not lead to the desired goal state. The configuration required block A to be on top of B, C on A, and D on C, but the actions taken failed to achieve this arrangement. This calls for a reassessment of the sequence to ensure each block is correctly placed in accordance with the goal.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(c:default,a:default) - Remove block C from atop block A, holding C.
2. put-down(c:default) - Place block C on the table, freeing the robot hand.
3. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up block A now that it is clear.
4. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stack block A on top of block B.
5. pick-up(c:default) - Pick up block C again.
6. stack(c:default,a:default) - Stack block C on top of block A.

- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the positions of the blocks relative to each other and their status (whether another block is on top of them), as well as the status of the robot hand.
pick-up(c:default):
In the environment, there are four objects named a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration:

- Block b is on top of block a.
- Block d is clear and placed on the table.
- Block c is being held by the robot hand.
- Block b is also clear.
- Block a is on the table.

This summary captures the positions and statuses of all blocks, which is crucial for planning the robot's next actions in the Blocksworld scenario.
stack(c:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block B is positioned on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B, forming a stack. Block D is placed directly on the table. Both block D and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Blocks A and D are also positioned on the table. The robot's hand is empty at this time. This setup requires careful manipulation of blocks to change their configuration using the robot's actions like picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking.
pick-up(d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is on the table, block B is stacked on top of block A, and block C is stacked on top of block B. Block C is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it. The robot hand is holding block D.
stack(d:default,c:default):
In the environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block C, and Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks as per its goal or further instructions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange a set of blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action sequence executed was correct in stacking order but failed initially to match the goal state's requirements. The goal state requires block A on top of B, C on top of A, and D on top of C. The sequence needs to start by rearranging the initial conditions to facilitate this specific order.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(a:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(a:default)' at index 4 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)

States Visited:
unstack(c:default,a:default):
In the current state of the environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the summary of their status:

- Block a is on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of it.
- Block b is also on the table and clear.
- Block c is being held by the robot hand.
- Block d is on the table and is clear as well.

This setup indicates that all blocks except for block c are resting on the table without any other blocks stacked on them, and the robot's hand is currently occupied with holding block c.
put-down(c:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is situated on the table and is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking any of the blocks.
pick-up(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a robot hand. Here's the status of each:

1. Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
2. Block B is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block C is on the table and it is also clear.
4. Block D is on the table and it is clear as well.

This setup indicates that the robot hand is currently occupied with holding block B, while the other three blocks are resting on the table without any blocks stacked on top of them.
stack(b:default,a:default):
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration and state:

- Block b is on top of block a.
- Block d is on the table and clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block c is also on the table and clear.
- Block a is on the table but not clear, as block b is on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the positions of the blocks relative to each other and their status (whether another block is on top of them), as well as the status of the robot hand.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the current configuration:

- Blocks A, B, and D are on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A.
- Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks as per its goal or further instructions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld domain, the objective is to rearrange a set of blocks so that block A is on top of block B, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The attempt to pick up block A after stacking block B on it was invalid because block A was not clear, being under block B. This oversight highlights the importance of ensuring that a block is clear (i.e., nothing is on top of it) before attempting to pick it up or interact with it. This is a fundamental rule in the Blocksworld domain that must be adhered to when planning the sequence of actions.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT

stack(d:default,c:default):
In the environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block C is on top of Block B.
- Block D is on top of Block C, and Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

This requires manipulating the blocks using a robot hand that can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed, to achieve the desired configuration of stacked blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The sequence followed correctly placed block D on top of C and block C on top of B, but unfortunately, the requirement to have block A on top of B was not met. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or misalignment in the execution of steps to achieve the goal state, where the order needs to be A on B, C on A, and D on C.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(c:default,a:default) - This moves block C from A to the robot hand.
2. put-down(c:default) - Places block C on the table, making all blocks clear.
3. pick-up(a:default) - Picks up block A since it's clear.
4. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stacks block A on B.
5. pick-up(c:default) - Picks up block C.
6. stack(c:default,a:default) - Stacks block C on A.
7. pick-up(d:default) - Picks up block D.
8. stack(d:default,c:default) - Stacks block D on C.

This revised sequence aims to directly align with the goal state requirements by first making all blocks clear and then stacking them in the precise required order: A on B, C on A, D on C.
