ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current scenario, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:
- Block A is on top of Block D.
- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block B is directly on the table.
- Block C is also directly on the table.

Additionally:
- Both Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.

This setup describes the starting or current state of the environment in the Blocksworld domain, where the goal is to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration using the robot.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is positioned on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the initial action sequence proposal without prior attempts, there is no error feedback or previous sequence reflection required. It is essential to plan the sequence carefully to achieve the goal state from the starting state using valid actions.

Think: To achieve the goal where block A is on block B, and block D is on block C, a sequence needs to be devised considering the current position of blocks:
1. Unstack block A from block D, since it's clear and on top of another block.
2. Put down block A on the table to free up the robot's hand.
3. Unstack block D from block B as it needs to be repositioned on block C.
4. Put down block D on the table.
5. Pick up block A (since it's now clear on the table) to eventually stack it on block B.
6. Stack block A on block B.
7. Pick up block D from the table.
8. Stack block D on block C.

This sequence ensures that the robot hand is appropriately used and reset by placing blocks on the table temporarily, enabling the reorganization needed to reach the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,d:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,d:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(d:default,b:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
