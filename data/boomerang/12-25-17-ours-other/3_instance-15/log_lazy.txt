ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Both blocks A and B are positioned on the table. Block C is stacked on top of block B. Block A and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty and not holding any blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the objective is to move block A on top of block B. This scene includes a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The robot can perform actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to achieve the goal configuration where block A is stacked directly on block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first action sequence being determined, there are no previous errors or feedback to reflect upon. The current scenario involves manipulating blocks A, B, and C to achieve the configuration of having block A on top of block B. 

Think: 
The goal is to have block A stacked on block B. Initially, block C is on top of B, which means block B is not clear and cannot have A placed on it directly. The robot hand is empty, which allows for picking up or unstacking blocks. The first step should be to clear block B by removing block C from it. Once block B is clear, block A can be picked up and stacked on it.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
