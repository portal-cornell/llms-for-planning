ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocks World scenario, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

- Block A is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is directly on top of Block D.
- Block C is directly on top of Block B and is clear, indicating nothing is on top of it.
- Block D is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup involves a stack where Block C is on Block B, which in turn is on Block D. Block A and Block D are resting directly on the table, and Blocks A and C are clear, meaning they can be interacted with by the robot hand. The objective in such scenarios typically involves rearranging these blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is directly on top of block A, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C. This creates a vertical stack of the blocks in the order A, B, C, D from bottom to top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given that this is the initial state and no actions have been performed yet, there's no specific error feedback or previous states to reflect upon. The goal is to rearrange the blocks into a vertical stack from A to D with A at the bottom and D at the top.

Think: The current configuration has C on B and B on D, while A and D are on the table. To reach the goal state, I need to reorganize the blocks as follows: A, B, C, D. The robot hand is empty, which allows me to pick up or unstack the blocks that are clear (A and C). The intended final order requires stacking B on A, then C on B, and finally D on C. To achieve this, I need to clear the way by first unstacking C from B and temporarily placing it somewhere, then moving B to A, and finally re-stacking C and D in the correct order.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
