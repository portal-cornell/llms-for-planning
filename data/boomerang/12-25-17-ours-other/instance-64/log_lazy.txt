ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A and block D are positioned on the table. Block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block D. Both blocks B and C are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first attempt at achieving the goal, there's no previous error feedback or action sequence to reflect upon. The initial setup involves blocks B and C being clear and on top of blocks A and D, respectively, while the goal requires switching the positions of blocks C and D. The robot hand is empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: To reach the goal state where block D is on top of block C, with block B already on block A, it's necessary to rearrange blocks C and D. Given the initial state, block C can be unstacked from D and placed on the table, which will then allow block D to be moved freely. The sequence needs to start by clearing the way for D to be moved on top of C:

1. Unstack C from D, placing C on the table.
2. Pick up D (as it is now clear and on the table).
3. Stack D on block C.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)
