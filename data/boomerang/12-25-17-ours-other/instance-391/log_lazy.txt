ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block B is currently on top of Block A. Both Blocks A and D are on the table, and Block C is also placed directly on the table. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as picking up any of the clear blocks or stacking one block on another that is clear and not held by the hand.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this Blocksworld scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B and block D is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial instruction, there are no previous errors to reflect upon. I need to create a sequence of actions that will arrange the blocks to match the goal state from the described starting configuration.

Think: To achieve the goal state of Block C on Block B and Block D on Block A, I need to:
1. Unblock Block A by moving Block B.
2. Pick up Block B since it's clear.
3. Put down Block B to clear the robot's hand.
4. Pick up Block D since it's clear and needs to be stacked on Block A.
5. Stack Block D on Block A.
6. Pick up Block C to prepare it to be stacked on Block B.
7. Stack Block C on Block B.

This sequence should rearrange the blocks from the starting state to match the goal state. 

Action Sequence: unstack(b,a), pick-up(b), put-down(b), pick-up(d), stack(d,a), pick-up(c), stack(c,b)

Error Feedback: The action 'unstack(b,a)' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicated that the action 'unstack(b,a)' was invalid due to an incorrect format. The correct format for the action should have been 'unstack(b:default,a:default)'. This highlights the importance of adhering strictly to the format specified in the environment description for each action.

Think: I need to adjust the format of the unstack action and reconsider the entire sequence to ensure it meets the goal state requirements, starting from the corrected action. The goal is to have block C on top of block B and block D on top of block A. The robot's hand is initially empty, and blocks B, C, and D are clear.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)
