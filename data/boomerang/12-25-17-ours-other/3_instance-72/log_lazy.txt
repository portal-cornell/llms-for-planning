ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks named a, b, and c. Block a is on the table, while block b is on top of block c, and block c is on top of block a. Block b is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. The robot's hand is currently empty.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, we have a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be placed on other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot's hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The current goal is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first sequence of actions, there is no prior feedback or error to reflect on. The goal is to arrange blocks so that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b'. The current configuration needs to be rearranged to meet this goal.

Think: The current configuration has block 'a' on the table, block 'c' on top of 'a', and block 'b' clear on top of 'c'. To achieve the goal state where 'a' is on top of 'b', the following steps should be considered:
1. Unstack block 'b' from 'c' since 'b' is clear and can be moved.
2. Place 'b' on the table to clear the way and make it possible to manipulate 'c'.
3. Unstack 'c' from 'a' to free up 'a'.
4. Place 'c' on the table, as it does not need to be stacked under the current goal.
5. Pick up 'a' and stack it on 'b' to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)
