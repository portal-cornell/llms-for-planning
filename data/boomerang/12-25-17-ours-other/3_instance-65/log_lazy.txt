ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Here's the current configuration and status of each:

- Block A is clear and stacked on top of Block C.
- Block B is clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block C is not clear as it has Block A on top of it, but it is placed on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any block.

This summary reflects the state of the environment, where each block's position and condition are specified, along with the status of the robot hand.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks such that block B is on top of block A, and block C is on top of block B, creating a stack in the order A-B-C. The robot hand will need to manipulate these blocks to achieve this specific configuration from their current positions.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the initial attempt at creating a sequence of actions to achieve the goal state, there are no previous errors or actions to reflect upon. Understanding the starting configuration and the goal is crucial. In the starting state, Block A is on C, and Block B is on the table. The goal is to have a stack of A-B-C.

Think: To achieve the goal state from the current state:
1. Block A needs to be moved from its current position on top of C to the table or directly on B.
2. Block B must be placed under Block A.
3. Finally, Block C must be stacked on top of Block B.

Given the valid actions, I can see that I can unstack A from C and pick up B. These actions will help rearrange the blocks as required.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]
