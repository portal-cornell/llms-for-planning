ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block a is placed on top of block c.
- Block b and block d are both directly on the table.
- Block c is stacked on top of block d.
- Both block a and block b are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform any operations needed for reconfiguring the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the initial attempt to formulate an action sequence. There is no prior error feedback to reflect on. The goal is to have block A positioned on top of block D. The current setup involves block A on top of block C, while block C is on top of block D. The robot hand is empty, allowing for an immediate action to manipulate the blocks.

Think: To achieve the goal of having block A on block D, the following steps seem necessary:
1. Since block A is on block C, I will need to unstack block A from block C first.
2. Block D is currently under block C, so block C will need to be moved off of block D to make D accessible.
3. Once block D is clear, I can then stack block A on block D.

Given the valid actions of picking up block B and unstacking block A from block C, the immediate action available that aligns with the goal is to unstack block A from block C.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]

Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(a:default,b:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
