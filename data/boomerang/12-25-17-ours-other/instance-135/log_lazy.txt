ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot's hand. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is positioned on top of Block D.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block A.
- Blocks B and D are placed directly on the table.
- Blocks B and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot's hand is currently empty, ready to perform an action such as picking up or moving a block.

This setup forms a stack with Blocks C, A, and D, while Block B is separate and directly on the table.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment involves arranging the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial environment starts with blocks C, A, and D in a stack, and block B alone on the table. The robot's hand is empty, which enables it to either pick up a clear block or unstack the top block of a stack. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that C is on A, and A is on B. Since the goal configuration differs from the initial configuration, strategic moves involving picking up and stacking need to be planned.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the first task is to clear block A (since it needs to be moved onto block B eventually), which means block C needs to be unstacked from A. After unstacking C, it would be wise to place it temporarily on the table since B needs to be clear to stack A on top of it. Once A is on B, C can then be stacked on A. The robot's hand being empty initially allows us to directly proceed with the unstacking of C from A.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(a:default,d:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]

Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(a:default,d:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
