ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Block 'b' is positioned on the table, while block 'a' is placed on top of block 'b'. Block 'c' is also on the table and both blocks 'a' and 'c' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup forms part of a scenario in a Blocks World domain where a robot can manipulate these blocks to achieve specific configurations.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In the environment, the objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block C. This setup involves various blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks by picking them up, stacking them, or placing them down. The robot hand can hold one block at a time or be empty. The goal is to achieve the specific configuration where block B is directly on block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first action sequence, there are no previous errors or feedback to reflect on. The initial state and valid actions are clearly defined. The goal is to place block 'b' on top of block 'c'. Currently, block 'b' is underneath block 'a', and block 'c' is clear and on the table. 

Think: 
To achieve the goal state where block 'b' is on top of block 'c', the robot must first clear block 'b' by removing block 'a'. After unstacking 'a' from 'b', the robot can then pick up 'b' and stack it onto 'c'. The sequence of actions should therefore involve unstacking 'a' from 'b', putting down 'a', picking up 'b', and finally stacking 'b' on 'c'. 

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)
