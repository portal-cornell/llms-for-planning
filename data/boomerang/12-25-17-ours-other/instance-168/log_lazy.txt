ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and other elements is as follows:

- Block b is on the table.
- Block a has block d placed on top of it, and block a is on block b.
- Block c is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that both block c and block d are free to be manipulated by the robot hand, either to move or to have another block stacked onto them.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks in a specific configuration where:
- Block A is placed on top of Block C,
- Block C is stacked on top of Block B,
- Block D is positioned on top of Block A.

This configuration requires a sequence of actions to move the blocks into the described layout, ensuring each block is clear before stacking another block on top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
The current starting state shows that blocks c and d are clear and can be manipulated. The goal state requires a specific stacking order: D on A, A on C, and C on B. The robot's hand is empty, which is suitable for picking up or unstacking blocks.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state, I need to rearrange the blocks as follows:
1. Unstack block d from block a because d needs to be placed on a later, and a needs to be stacked on c.
2. Put down block d on the table, temporarily, as it needs to be free to pick up later.
3. Unstack block a from block b because block b will be the base for c.
4. Put down block a temporarily.
5. Pick up block c and stack it on block b.
6. Pick up block a again and stack it on block c.
7. Finally, pick up block d and stack it on block a.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
