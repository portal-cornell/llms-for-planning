ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current state of the environment:
- Block A is on top of Block C.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Both Blocks D and E are on the table.
- Blocks B, D, and E are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- Block C is also on the table, but it has Block A on top of it, making it not clear.
- The robot hand is empty.

This setup involves five blocks named A, B, C, D, and E, each placed in specific configurations either on the table or on top of each other, with certain blocks being accessible for manipulation by the robot hand.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- pick-up(e:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block D is positioned on top of block C. This is part of a scenario where multiple blocks can be manipulated by a robot hand, either placed on each other or on a table, with the aim of achieving specific configurations.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first attempt, there is no previous feedback or error to reflect upon. The objective is to move Block D onto Block C. Currently, Block C is not clear, as it has Block A on top of it. The robot's hand is empty, which allows for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: The strategy to achieve the goal state involves clearing Block C so it can receive Block D. To do this, I must first unstack Block B from Block A and then unstack Block A from Block C. After Block C is clear, Block D, which is already on the table and clear, can be picked up and stacked onto Block C. The sequence of actions should therefore focus on unstacking B from A, moving B to the table, then unstacking A from C, and finally stacking D onto C.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
