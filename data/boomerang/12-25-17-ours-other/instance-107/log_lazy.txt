ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robotic hand. Here's a summary of the current state:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on top of block c and block b is clear.
- Block c is on the table.
- Block d is on top of block a and block d is clear.
- The robotic hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks are arranged in a vertical stack with block d on block a, and block b on block c, all while blocks b and d are clear and ready to be moved or manipulated. The robotic hand being empty suggests that it is ready to perform actions such as picking up a clear block.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the objective is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is positioned on top of block C, and block B is on top of block A. This configuration will fulfill the goal state required by the environment.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
Given the initial state and the goal state, the actions need to be sequenced correctly to achieve the desired arrangement of blocks. Since the robotic hand is empty, the valid initial moves involve unstacking blocks b or d, which are both in clear positions.

Think:
To reach the goal state where block A is on block C, and block B is on block A:
1. Unstack block d from block a.
2. Put down block d on the table to keep it clear and out of the way.
3. Unstack block b from block c.
4. Put down block b on the table.
5. Pick up block a and stack it on block c.
6. Pick up block b and stack it on block a.

These actions respect the current clear statuses and the robotic hand's capacity. The sequence ensures every block involved moves to its target position without unnecessary adjustments.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]

Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
