ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current state of the Blocksworld environment:
- Block 'a' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'c' is placed on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and it has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- The robot's hand is empty.
- Block 'c' is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.

The objects involved are three blocks labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The setup allows for potential actions such as moving block 'c' or manipulating block 'b' due to their clear status, and the robotâ€™s hand being free to perform tasks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, and block B is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the current configuration of blocks and the goal state, I need to devise a sequence of actions that will rearrange these blocks into the desired configuration: A on B, and B on C. The robot's hand is empty, and blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, providing a starting point for manipulation.

Think: The goal is to have A on B and B on C. Initially, block 'c' is on 'a', which is not useful for achieving the goal configuration. To create the desired stack:
1. I should first free up block 'a' by removing block 'c' from it.
2. Next, block 'b' needs to be clear to place 'c' on it, which it already is.
3. Once 'c' is on 'b', block 'a' can be placed on top of this stack.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
