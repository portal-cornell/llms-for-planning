ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks, labeled A, B, C, and D. The arrangement of these blocks is as follows:
- Block A is placed on top of Block B.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C is directly on the table.

Additionally, Block A is clear, which means there is no block on top of it, and the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform an operation such as picking up or moving a block.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks so that block A is positioned directly on top of block D. This setup involves various blocks, a table for placing blocks, and a robot hand which can manipulate one block at a time. The robot can perform actions such as picking up, putting down, and stacking blocks to achieve specific configurations, such as the goal where block A needs to be on block D.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the starting state, the robot's hand is empty, and Block A is clear and on top of Block B. The valid action listed is to unstack, which means separating blocks that are stacked together. The goal state requires Block A to be directly on top of Block D, so adjustments to the current block stack need to be made.

Think: To achieve the goal where Block A is on Block D, I must first unstack the blocks to separate them. Then, I need to rearrange them to achieve the goal configuration. Since only 'unstack' is mentioned as a valid action, I will assume that 'stack' and other necessary actions like 'pick-up' and 'put-down' are implicitly available but were not listed due to an oversight.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
