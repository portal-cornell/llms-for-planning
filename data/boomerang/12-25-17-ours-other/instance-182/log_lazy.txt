ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block A is on top of Block C, which is directly on the table.
- Block C is on the table.

Additionally, Block D is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of D. The robot hand is currently empty and not holding any blocks. This setup provides a clear structure of the blocks and the status of the robot hand in preparation for executing actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup will require careful manipulation using the robot hand to stack the blocks in the desired order.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first sequence of actions and there is no prior error feedback, the task is to understand the environment and plan the sequence carefully based on the valid actions and the goal state.

Think: The current configuration is D on B, B on A, A on C, and C on the table. The goal is to have A on B, B on C, D on A. To achieve this, we must rearrange the blocks. The robot hand is empty, and the valid action available is to unstack D from B. This will allow further manipulation of the blocks to reach the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'pick-up(a:default)' at index 4 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)

States Visited:
unstack(d:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows: Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on top of Block A, and Block C is directly on the table. Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding Block D.
put-down(d:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the configuration and status of each object:

- Block B is clear and is placed on top of Block A.
- Block D is clear and is directly on the table.
- Block C is also directly on the table.
- Block A is positioned on top of Block C.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup provides a clear overview of the positions and statuses of the blocks, which is essential for planning actions such as moving blocks or changing their configurations using the robot hand.
unstack(b:default,a:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- Block d is clear and on the table.
- Block b is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block a is clear and is placed on top of block c.
- Block c is directly on the table.

This setup describes the initial state of the blocks in relation to each other and the status of the robot's hand.
put-down(b:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the summary of their arrangement and statuses:

- Block A is positioned on top of Block C and is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of Block A.
- Block B and Block D are both on the table and they are also clear.
- Block C is also on the table, but it has Block A on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup describes the starting or current state of the blocks in relation to each other, the table, and the robot hand.

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block A is on top of Block C, which is directly on the table.
- Block C is on the table.

Additionally, Block D is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of D. The robot hand is currently empty and not holding any blocks. This setup provides a clear structure of the blocks and the status of the robot hand in preparation for executing actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. This setup will require careful manipulation using the robot hand to stack the blocks in the desired order.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The invalid action 'pick-up(a:default)' was attempted when block A was not clear, leading to the invalid action error. Understanding the structure and clear status of blocks before attempting actions is crucial.

Think: Based on the feedback and valid actions listed after each state, I need to adjust the action sequence to avoid picking up a block that is not clear. Instead, I should follow the valid actions available at each state and sequence them correctly to reach the goal.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,b:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
