ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A and block B are positioned on the table. Block C is placed on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. Both blocks C and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot hand is not holding any blocks at this moment, indicating it is empty.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block D and block B is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the initial attempt at solving the problem. Since no previous actions have been taken or errors reported, we can start formulating a plan based on the starting state and the goal state.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block D and block B is on top of block C, we need to rearrange the blocks accordingly. Currently, block C is on block B and block D is on block A. First, we need to free up the blocks by using unstack actions and then use stack actions to reach the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)"]
