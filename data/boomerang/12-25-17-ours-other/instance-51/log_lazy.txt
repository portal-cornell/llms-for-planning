ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:
- Block D is on top of Block B, and both blocks B and D are clear.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that Block A, being on Block C, is not directly on the table, and Block D, though clear, is placed above Block B. The empty hand of the robot suggests readiness for an action, such as picking up a block or stacking one block on another.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks from D at the bottom to A at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback from previous steps as this is the initial action sequence proposal. The starting state involves blocks A and D being clear and the robot's hand being empty. The goal is to stack all blocks in a specific sequence (A on B, B on C, C on D).

Think: To achieve the goal state, the blocks need to be rearranged from the current configuration. Block D, which is clear and on top of B, can be moved first. After unstacking D from B, D can be eventually moved to the table, followed by stacking operations to align blocks according to the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' at index 9 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)

States Visited:
unstack(d:default,b:default):
In the current environment, we have four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration and status of each:

- Block A is placed on top of Block C and has nothing on it, making it clear.
- Block B is positioned directly on the table and is also clear.
- Block C is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

This setup indicates that Blocks A and B are available for manipulation since they are clear, and Block D is already being held by the robot hand, ready for an action like placing it down or stacking it on another block. Block C, while not clear, serves as the base for Block A.
put-down(d:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block a is on top of block c.
- Block b is clear and on the table.
- Block c is on the table.
- Block d is clear and also on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty at the moment. This setup indicates that blocks a, b, and d are not obstructed by other blocks and can be manipulated by the robot hand.
unstack(a:default,c:default):
In the current scenario, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. These blocks are positioned as follows:
- Blocks b, d, and c are on the table.
- Block a is being held by the robot hand.

Additionally, blocks b, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them, allowing for potential placement or manipulation.
put-down(a:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is currently placed on the table and is clear, meaning that no other block is stacked on top of any of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment, indicating that it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed.
pick-up(b:default):
In the current environment setup of a Blocksworld domain with a robot and several blocks, we have four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The situation is as follows:

- Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.

This configuration represents the initial or current state of the blocks and their relation to the table and the robot's hand.
stack(b:default,c:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup is as follows:

- Block D is located on the table and is clear from any other blocks on top of it.
- Block B is placed on top of Block C and is also clear.
- Block A is on the table and is clear.
- Block C is directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This configuration sets the stage where each block is either on another block or directly on the table, and the robot is ready to manipulate these blocks as needed.
pick-up(a:default):
In the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the current configuration:
- Block D is clear and is placed on the table.
- Block C is also on the table.
- Block A is being held by the robot hand.
- Block B is clear and is positioned on top of Block C.
stack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as a, b, c, and d. These objects represent blocks in a Blocksworld scenario. Here's the summary of the current state based on the provided predicates:

1. Block a is on top of block b, and block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block a.
2. Block b is on top of block c.
3. Block d is on the table and is clear, implying no other blocks are stacked on block d.
4. Block c is also located directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a specific configuration of blocks where a is stacked on b, b is stacked on c, and d is independently on the table, with no blocks impeding movement or placement of the clear blocks (a and d). The robot hand being empty indicates readiness to pick up or manipulate blocks as needed.
pick-up(d:default):
In the given environment, there are four objects, labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The configuration of these objects is described by several predicates:

1. Object 'a' is positioned on top of object 'b'.
2. Object 'b' is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
3. Object 'c' is on the table, indicating it is directly placed on the table without any other objects on top.
4. Object 'b' is on top of object 'c'.
5. The robot hand is currently holding object 'd'.

This setup involves a stack where 'a' is on 'b', and 'b' is in turn on 'c', which is on the table. Meanwhile, object 'd' is being held by the robot hand and is not part of the stack.

Starting State:
In the current environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:
- Block D is on top of Block B, and both blocks B and D are clear.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that Block A, being on Block C, is not directly on the table, and Block D, though clear, is placed above Block B. The empty hand of the robot suggests readiness for an action, such as picking up a block or stacking one block on another.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks from D at the bottom to A at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicated that the action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' was invalid because at that state, the valid actions available were to either put down block D or stack it on block A. This suggests that block C was not clear or accessible for stacking block D on it. The sequence of actions must ensure that each block intended to be below another must be clear and accessible. The sequence must be adjusted to respect the state and arrangement of the blocks.

Think: The goal requires stacking blocks in the order A on B, B on C, C on D. To achieve this, I must ensure that blocks are picked up, put down, or stacked only when valid and when the target block is clear. Reviewing the goal and the error, I need to adjust the sequence to correctly stack D on C after ensuring that C is available for stacking.

Action Sequence: 
- unstack(d:default,b:default), 
- put-down(d:default), 
- unstack(a:default,c:default), 
- put-down(a:default), 
- pick-up(b:default), 
- stack(b:default,c:default), 
- pick-up(d:default), 
- stack(d:default,c:default),

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlighted that the action '-unstack(d:default,b:default)' was invalid due to an incorrect format used in the response (presence of a hyphen). Instead, the correct action should have been formatted without the hyphen. This highlights the importance of adhering strictly to the specified action format to avoid such errors.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block B, block B on top of block C, and block C on top of block D, I need to carefully plan the sequence based on the current configuration. First, I'll unstack blocks that are not in their goal placements, then use the 'put-down' action to place them temporarily on the table, and finally stack them in the correct order.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks from D at the bottom to A at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The repeated mistake was attempting to stack block D on block C when block C was not clear. From the valid actions provided (put-down(d:default) and stack(d:default,a:default)), it was evident that my previous plan did not consider the state constraints effectively. This calls for a more careful planning approach that ensures each block is clear before attempting to stack another block on it.

Think: Since the final goal is a vertical stack from D at the bottom to A on top (D, C, B, A), I should first ensure the base block (D) is placed at the bottom. Then, I can systematically place each block on top, verifying that the block below is clear and ready to be stacked upon.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(d:default,b:default) - pick up D from B, which makes B clear.
2. put-down(d:default) - place D on the table, making it clear and available for further action.
3. unstack(a:default,c:default) - pick up A from C, which makes C clear.
4. put-down(a:default) - place A on the table, making it clear and available for further action.
5. pick-up(c:default) - pick up C, preparing to stack it.
6. stack(c:default,d:default) - place C on D, initiating the bottom setup of the goal configuration.
7. pick-up(b:default) - pick up B, preparing to stack it.
8. stack(b:default,c:default) - place B on C, adding to the stack.
9. pick-up(a:default) - pick up A, the final block to complete the stack.
10. stack(a:default,b:default) - place A on B, completing the stack from D to A as required. 

This sequence ensures that each block's placement is validated for the block below to be clear, aligning the actions with the goal state configuration.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback highlights that the description I provided for the action was invalid due to the inclusion of unnecessary text ("1." and " - pick up D from B"). This mistake underscores the importance of strictly adhering to the specified action format without adding extra descriptions or numbers. The action sequence must only include the exact action commands as defined by the environment.

Think: To correctly sequence the actions from the starting state to the goal state, I will focus strictly on the valid actions given and ensure that each action is formatted exactly as required. Since unstacking D from B was a valid action, I will start with that and then plan the subsequent steps ensuring each block is clear before stacking.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback consistently highlighted that the action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' was invalid due to the incorrect state of block C not being clear for stacking. It's crucial to adjust the sequence to ensure the final actions respect the clear status of each block needed for stacking.

Think: To successfully achieve the goal state, I need to ensure that when stacking block D on block C, block C must be clear. This requires adjusting the sequence so that all blocks are properly stacked without prematurely attempting to stack a block on another that isn't clear.

Action Sequence: 
- unstack(d:default,b:default), 
- put-down(d:default), 
- unstack(a:default,c:default), 
- put-down(a:default), 
- pick-up(b:default), 
- stack(b:default,c:default), 
- pick-up(a:default), 
- stack(a:default,b:default), 
- pick-up(d:default), 
- stack(d:default,a:default) 

This revised sequence now ends with stacking D on A after ensuring A is on B and B is on C, instead of attempting to stack D on C, which was not clear.

Think: To avoid previous mistakes and ensure that each action is valid, I need to correctly format each action and follow the state dependencies strictly. It’s vital to sequence the actions to ensure each block becomes clear before attempting to stack another block on it.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' at index 7 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)

States Visited:
unstack(d:default,b:default):
In the current environment, we have four objects: blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the configuration and status of each:

- Block A is placed on top of Block C and has nothing on it, making it clear.
- Block B is positioned directly on the table and is also clear.
- Block C is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

This setup indicates that Blocks A and B are available for manipulation since they are clear, and Block D is already being held by the robot hand, ready for an action like placing it down or stacking it on another block. Block C, while not clear, serves as the base for Block A.
put-down(d:default):
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block a is on top of block c.
- Block b is clear and on the table.
- Block c is on the table.
- Block d is clear and also on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty at the moment. This setup indicates that blocks a, b, and d are not obstructed by other blocks and can be manipulated by the robot hand.
unstack(a:default,c:default):
In the current scenario, we have four objects identified as blocks a, b, c, and d. These blocks are positioned as follows:
- Blocks b, d, and c are on the table.
- Block a is being held by the robot hand.

Additionally, blocks b, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them, allowing for potential placement or manipulation.
put-down(a:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is currently placed on the table and is clear, meaning that no other block is stacked on top of any of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment, indicating that it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated as needed.
pick-up(b:default):
In the current environment setup of a Blocksworld domain with a robot and several blocks, we have four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The situation is as follows:

- Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.

This configuration represents the initial or current state of the blocks and their relation to the table and the robot's hand.
stack(b:default,c:default):
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The setup is as follows:

- Block D is located on the table and is clear from any other blocks on top of it.
- Block B is placed on top of Block C and is also clear.
- Block A is on the table and is clear.
- Block C is directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is empty at the moment.

This configuration sets the stage where each block is either on another block or directly on the table, and the robot is ready to manipulate these blocks as needed.
pick-up(d:default):
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block A is placed on the table and has no other block on top of it, making it clear. Similarly, Block C is also on the table, but Block B is stacked on top of Block C. Block B is clear as there is no block on top of it. The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

Starting State:
In the current environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:
- Block D is on top of Block B, and both blocks B and D are clear.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that Block A, being on Block C, is not directly on the table, and Block D, though clear, is placed above Block B. The empty hand of the robot suggests readiness for an action, such as picking up a block or stacking one block on another.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks from D at the bottom to A at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action 'stack(d:default,c:default)' was invalid once again because Block C was not clear to stack Block D on it. The valid actions listed included stacking D on either A or B, indicating that I should have considered the state of block C more carefully and adjusted the sequence accordingly.

Think: To reach the goal state where A is on B, B is on C, and C is on D, the action sequence must respect the state of each block ensuring they are clear before stacking. The mistake was attempting to stack D on C prematurely. I need to alter the sequence to stack D only when C is clear and ready.

Action Sequence: 
- unstack(d:default,b:default),
- put-down(d:default),
- unstack(a:default,c:default),
- put-down(a:default),
- pick-up(b:default),
- stack(b:default,c:default),
- pick-up(d:default),
- stack(d:default,c:default),
- pick-up(a:default),
- stack(a:default,b:default) 

This sequence ensures that each block is clear before stacking, adhering to the valid actions at each state, and gradually building towards the goal configuration.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The repeated invalid action of 'stack(d:default,c:default)' indicates a misunderstanding of the environment's current state where block C remains not clear for stacking D on it. Instead, valid actions provided were to stack D on A or B. This requires adjusting the sequence to use the correct stacking options based on the available state information.

Think: Given the error feedback and the valid actions provided, it's clear that stacking D directly on C is not feasible due to block B being on C. Instead, stacking D on A or B after they are properly positioned should be considered. The goal is to ultimately have A on B, B on C, and D on C, but the order of actions must ensure each stacking action is valid based on the blocks' clear status.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)

- Block B is clear and is positioned on top of Block C.
stack(a:default,b:default):
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as a, b, c, and d. These objects represent blocks in a Blocksworld scenario. Here's the summary of the current state based on the provided predicates:

1. Block a is on top of block b, and block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block a.
2. Block b is on top of block c.
3. Block d is on the table and is clear, implying no other blocks are stacked on block d.
4. Block c is also located directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a specific configuration of blocks where a is stacked on b, b is stacked on c, and d is independently on the table, with no blocks impeding movement or placement of the clear blocks (a and d). The robot hand being empty indicates readiness to pick up or manipulate blocks as needed.
pick-up(d:default):
In the given environment, there are four objects, labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The configuration of these objects is described by several predicates:

1. Object 'a' is positioned on top of object 'b'.
2. Object 'b' is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
3. Object 'c' is on the table, indicating it is directly placed on the table without any other objects on top.
4. Object 'b' is on top of object 'c'.
5. The robot hand is currently holding object 'd'.

This setup involves a stack where 'a' is on 'b', and 'b' is in turn on 'c', which is on the table. Meanwhile, object 'd' is being held by the robot hand and is not part of the stack.

Starting State:
In the current environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:
- Block D is on top of Block B, and both blocks B and D are clear.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks from D at the bottom to A at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action 'stack(d:default,b:default)' was invalid despite the fact that block B was clear, which suggests an oversight in understanding the state after previous actions. The valid actions indicated were to stack D on A or simply put it down. This requires careful consideration of the block arrangements and their availability for stacking based on the clear status.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(d:default,b:default) - Pick up D from B, making B clear.
2. put-down(d:default) - Place D on the table, keeping it clear.
3. unstack(a:default,c:default) - Pick up A from C, making C clear.
4. put-down(a:default) - Place A on the table, keeping it clear.
5. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up B from the table.
6. stack(b:default,c:default) - Stack B on C.
7. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up A from the table.
8. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stack A on B.
9. pick-up(d:default) - Pick up D from the table.
10. stack(d:default,a:default) - Stack D on A, following the valid actions provided.

This revised sequence is intended to match the goal of stacking all blocks in the correct order while adhering to the rules observed from the environment's feedback about valid actions.

This setup involves a stack where 'a' is on 'b', and 'b' is in turn on 'c', which is on the table. Meanwhile, object 'd' is being held by the robot hand and is not part of the stack.
stack(d:default,a:default):
In this Blocksworld environment, the current configuration and state involve four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is a description of the state:

1. Block a has block d placed on top of it, and block b is positioned on top of block c.
2. Block c is resting on the table.
3. Block d is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
4. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.

This set-up describes the starting or current situation involving the blocks, their positions relative to each other and the table, as well as the status of the robot hand.

Starting State:
In the current environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:
- Block D is on top of Block B, and both blocks B and D are clear.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that Block A, being on Block C, is not directly on the table, and Block D, though clear, is placed above Block B. The empty hand of the robot suggests readiness for an action, such as picking up a block or stacking one block on another.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks from D at the bottom to A at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The action sequence failed to meet the goal state due to not satisfying the predicate 'on(c:default,d:default)', meaning block C was not placed on top of block D. This indicates that I need to adjust the final steps in the sequence to ensure that block C is placed on top of block D instead of placing block D on top of another block initially.

Action Sequence: 
1. unstack(d:default,b:default) - Remove D from B, hand is now holding D.
2. put-down(d:default) - Place D on the table, clearing it.
3. unstack(a:default,c:default) - Remove A from C, hand is now holding A.
4. put-down(a:default) - Place A on the table, clearing it.
5. pick-up(c:default) - Pick up C from the table.
6. stack(c:default,d:default) - Stack C on D.
7. pick-up(b:default) - Pick up B from the table.
8. stack(b:default,c:default) - Stack B on C.
9. pick-up(a:default) - Pick up A from the table.
10. stack(a:default,b:default) - Stack A on B.

This sequence ensures that all blocks are stacked in the order D at the bottom, followed by C, then B, and topped by A, meeting the goal state requirements.

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------

Error Feedback: The action '1.unstack(d:default,b:default)-RemoveDfromB' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)

States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows:
- Block D is on top of Block B, and both blocks B and D are clear.
- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that Block A, being on Block C, is not directly on the table, and Block D, though clear, is placed above Block B. The empty hand of the robot suggests readiness for an action, such as picking up a block or stacking one block on another.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the environment is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on top of block B, block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This setup will create a vertical stack of the blocks from D at the bottom to A at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback again indicates an issue with the formatting of the action command due to the inclusion of annotations and descriptions. It is crucial to ensure that actions are submitted in the exact format specified by the environment.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)
