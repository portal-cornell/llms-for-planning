ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Blocks A and B are currently placed on the table. Block C is positioned on top of Block B. Both Blocks A and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are multiple blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The objective is to rearrange the blocks into a specific configuration. Specifically, the goal is to stack block B on top of block A, and then stack block C on top of block B. This setup requires the blocks to be moved and stacked in sequence, ensuring that each block is clear before another can be placed on top of it. The robot hand can assist by picking up, moving, and stacking the blocks as needed to achieve this configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the initial attempt at creating a sequence of actions to achieve the goal state from the starting state. The starting state has Blocks A and B on the table, with C on top of B. The goal is to have B on A, then C on B. The robot hand is currently empty, allowing for picking up or unstacking actions.

Think: To achieve the goal state from the current configuration, the plan should start by making Block B available to be placed on Block A. Since Block C is on top of Block B, it must be moved first. The robot can unstack C from B, given that it's a valid action. After unstacking C, the robot will hold C, and both A and B will be clear. The robot can then place C down temporarily, stack B on A, pick up C again, and finally stack C on B. This sequence ensures all blocks are clear when needed and follows the valid actions available.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]

Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]
