ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A and block C are positioned on the table. Block B is stacked on top of block A. Both block B and block C are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is directly on top of block B, and block C is directly on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current scenario, no previous actions have been taken, and no error feedback has been provided. The robot hand is empty, and the action must begin from this state. The goal is to rearrange blocks so that A is on B and C is on A, which means the final stack should be C on A on B.

Think: The initial state has B on A and both C and A on the table. The robot can either pick up C or unstack B from A. To achieve the goal state, we need to first clear A (as it needs to go on top of B eventually). This means our first action should be to unstack B from A. After B is unstacked, it can be put down on the table to clear the robot hand. Then, the robot can pick up A and stack it on B. Finally, the robot can pick up C and stack it on A to achieve the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]

Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
