ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. Block a is on the table, and block c is directly on top of block a. Block d is also on the table, and block b is on top of block d. Both blocks b and c are clear, indicating that there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, allowing it to pick up any clear block. This setup forms the initial configuration of the environment where the robot can interact with the blocks to rearrange them according to specific goals.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, we have a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can either be positioned on top of other blocks or directly on the table. Each block that does not have another block on top of it is considered clear. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

Currently, the goal in the environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is directly on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In the current scenario, block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A. To achieve the goal of stacking block B directly on top of block C, we need to first make block C accessible as a base by unstacking it from block A. Once block C is on the table and clear, block B can be moved onto block C.

Think: Since the robot's hand is empty, the first action should be to unstack block C from block A to make block C a clear block on the table. After unstacking block C, the robot can then unstack block B from block D. Once both blocks are clear and on the table, the robot can then stack block B on top of block C, achieving the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)
