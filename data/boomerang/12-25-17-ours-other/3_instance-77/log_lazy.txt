ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each of these blocks, 'a', 'b', and 'c', is clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current goal is to have block B placed directly on top of block C. This setup involves manipulating various blocks, the table, and a robot hand that can hold only one block at a time or be empty. The actions available to achieve this configuration include picking up a block, putting down a block, stacking one block on top of another, and unstacking a block from another.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the initial sequence proposal and there has been no error feedback, no reflection on past errors is required. It is important to carefully consider the goal state and design a sequence of actions that progresses logically from the starting state to the goal state using valid actions.

Think: 
The goal is to have block 'b' on top of block 'c'. In the starting state, all blocks ('a', 'b', 'c') are on the table and the robot's hand is empty. The plan should involve picking up block 'b' first, since it needs to be stacked on 'c'. After picking up 'b', 'c' must be clear to place 'b' on it, which it currently is. Thus, the sequence starts with picking up 'b', then stacking 'b' onto 'c'.

Action Sequence: pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
