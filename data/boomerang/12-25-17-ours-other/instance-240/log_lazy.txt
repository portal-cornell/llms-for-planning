ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks A, B, and D are placed directly on the table. Block C is stacked on top of block D. The blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange block 'd' on top of block 'c' in the Blocksworld environment. This setting involves multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of moving the blocks either by stacking them on each other or placing them on the table. The robot hand can also pick up blocks or put them down to achieve the desired configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the initial action sequence proposal, there are no previous errors or feedback to consider. The key is to understand the valid actions available from the starting state and how they can be utilized to reach the goal state.

Think: The goal is to have block D on top of block C. In the starting state, block C is on top of block D, which is the reverse of the desired configuration. The first step is to free block D by moving block C. Since block C is clear and on top of block D, the appropriate action is to unstack C from D. After unstacking, block C will be in the robot's hand, and I will need to put it down on the table to free the robot's hand. Next, I will pick up block D and stack it on block C. This sequence should lead to the desired goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
