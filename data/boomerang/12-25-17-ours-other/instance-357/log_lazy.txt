ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their status:

- Block 'a' is placed on the table.
- Block 'b' is placed on top of block 'c'.
- Block 'c' is placed on the table.
- Block 'd' is on top of block 'a'.

Additionally, blocks 'b' and 'd' are clear, meaning there is no block on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block B, and block C is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first attempt at creating an action sequence in this environment, there are no previous mistakes or feedback to reflect upon. However, it's important to understand the rules and constraints of the environment: the robot can only hold one block at a time, blocks must be clear to be picked up or unstacked, and the goal state describes a specific configuration of blocks.

Think:
The goal state requires block 'a' on top of block 'b', and block 'c' on top of block 'a'. The current configuration needs to be rearranged to meet this requirement. First, block 'd' must be moved from 'a' to allow other operations on 'a'. Then, 'a' can be moved as needed to stack 'b' and 'c' appropriately. Since the robot hand is empty, the first action can be to unstack either 'b' or 'd'.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
