ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. All of these blocks are currently placed on the table, and each one of them is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of any of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any block. This setup allows for any block to be picked up or manipulated according to the desired configuration changes.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A. This setup implies that blocks A and D are directly on the table, or at least positioned in a way that allows blocks B and C to be stacked on them respectively. The robot hand will be used to reconfigure the blocks to achieve this specific arrangement.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first sequence of actions, there are no previous errors or states to reflect upon. I need to carefully consider the correct order of actions to achieve the goal from the starting state, ensuring the robot's hand is used efficiently and the blocks are manipulated without violating the rules.

Think: The goal is to have B on D and C on A with both D and A on the table. Starting with all blocks on the table and the robot hand empty, I must first pick up block B, as it does not need to be the base. After placing B on D, I will then pick up C to place it on A. Given that all blocks are clear and on the table, the sequence should involve a series of pick-up and stack actions.

Action Sequence: pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
