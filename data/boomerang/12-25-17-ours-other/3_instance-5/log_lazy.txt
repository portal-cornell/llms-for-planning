ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, which involves a set of blocks and operations by a robot hand, we have three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Here's the configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
2. Block B, in turn, is on top of Block C.
3. Block A is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.
4. Block C is directly on the table.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the initial or current state of the blocks and robot hand interactions in this environment.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block A. This setup requires careful manipulation using the robot hand to achieve the desired configuration of the blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial state shows block A on top of B, which is on top of C, and all are on the table. The robot hand is empty. The goal is to have B on C, and C on A, which is a complete reversal of the current stack order. We need to carefully plan the sequence of unstacking and stacking actions to rearrange these blocks without violating the rules of the environment.

Think: To achieve the goal state, I need to unstack A from B and put it down, then unstack B from C and put it down, finally, I will pick up C and stack it on A, and then pick up B to stack it on C. This plan assumes that the robot hand can only hold one block at a time, and each block must be clear to be picked up or unstacked.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
