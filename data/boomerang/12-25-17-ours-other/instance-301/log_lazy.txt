ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current scenario, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The arrangement and status of each are as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on the table and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block c is stacked on top of block a and is clear.
- Block d is also on the table and is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block. This setup forms the basis for actions that might include moving blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the objective involves rearranging blocks such that block b is positioned on top of block c, and block c is on top of block d. This setup requires carefully planning movements to achieve the specified stacking order of the blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial setup and no actions have been taken yet, there's no previous reflection or error feedback to consider. The current state informs us of the positions of the blocks, and the valid actions available suggest the feasible motions based on the robot's capability and the blocks' current status.

Think: To reach the goal state where block b is on c, and c is on d, I must first clear the path for these movements. Given the starting state:
- Block c is on a, so I have to unstack c from a.
- Both b and d are clear and on the table, but I need to stack c on d.
- After placing c on d, I can then place b on c.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,a:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
