ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Each of these blocks is positioned on the table, and each block is clear, meaning no other block is placed on top of them. Furthermore, the robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating any of these blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial sequence of actions, there is no previous feedback to consider. The main objective is to rearrange the blocks according to the goal state described. We have all blocks on the table and clear, and our robot hand is empty.

Think: The goal state requires that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C. To achieve this configuration, the sequence should ideally start by picking up block B, placing block C on top of B, then picking up D and placing it on top of C. Given the initial state where all blocks are clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty, the first action should involve picking up a block that we need to place first as the base, which is B in this case.

Action Sequence: pick-up(b:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 6
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
