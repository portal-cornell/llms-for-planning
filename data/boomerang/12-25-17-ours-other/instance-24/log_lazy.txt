ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block A is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block D.
- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Block C is directly on the table.
Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup is part of a Blocks World scenario where the robot can manipulate these blocks to achieve a different configuration.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate the blocks. The blocks can be placed on top of each other or on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty. The goal here is to rearrange the blocks so that block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the first action sequence, there is no feedback or previous actions to reflect upon. We start with the initial configuration of blocks and aim to achieve the described goal state.

Think: 
The initial state has block A on B, block B on D, and block D on C, with C on the table. The goal is to have C on A and D on B. To achieve this, the following steps are needed:
1. Unstack block A from B.
2. Put down block A on the table.
3. Unstack block B from D.
4. Put down block B on the table.
5. Unstack block D from C.
6. Stack block D on block B.
7. Pick up block C.
8. Stack block C on block A.

These steps ensure that each block is moved without violating the rules of only moving clear blocks and placing them either on another block or the table when the robot's hand is empty or holding a block.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), stack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(d:default,c:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(d:default,c:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
