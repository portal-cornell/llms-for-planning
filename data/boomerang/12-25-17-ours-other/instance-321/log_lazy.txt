ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current state of the environment within the Blocksworld domain, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each block has a specific positioning and status:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block C is on the table.
- Block D is on top of Block A.

Additionally, the top surfaces of Blocks B, C, and D are clear, indicating that there is no block placed on top of these blocks. The robot's hand is empty, suggesting it is ready to perform an action such as picking up or moving a block.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A. The robot hand will need to execute a series of moves to achieve this configuration from the current state of the blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial instruction and there is no prior error feedback or set of actions, let's carefully analyze the current and goal states to formulate an efficient action sequence. We need to avoid unnecessary block movements and ensure that each action is valid given the current state of the blocks and the robot's capabilities.

Think: The goal is to have block A on top of block B, and block D on top of block A. From the starting state:
- Block D is already on top of block A, but it needs to be moved to allow block A to be placed on block B.
- Block B is on top of Block C and needs to be cleared to position block A on top of it.

1. Start by moving block D from the top of block A to a clear spot (the table or another clear block). Since only block C is clear and on the table, we can't put D there directly because our goal state requires A on B. So, we put D on the table.
2. Next, unstack block B from block C and put it down on the table or another clear space.
3. Then, pick up block A (since it is now clear) and stack it on block B.
4. Finally, pick up block D from the table and stack it on block A.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,a:default)"]
