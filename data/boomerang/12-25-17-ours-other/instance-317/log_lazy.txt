ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:
- Block B is on top of Block A.
- Block D is on top of Block C.
- Both Blocks A and C are directly on the table.
- Blocks B and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as picking up clear blocks or stacking and unstacking blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block D, and block B is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the first attempt at proposing an action sequence. The initial state shows blocks B and D as clear and on top of blocks A and C respectively. The goal state requires block A on top of block D, with block B on block A. This configuration indicates that both blocks B and D must be moved.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the robot hand must first unstack blocks B and D. Then, the robot must rearrange blocks A and D, placing A on D. Finally, B should be stacked on A. Given that the robot's hand starts empty and can only hold one block at a time, the actions must be sequenced carefully to avoid illegal actions like picking up a block that isn't clear.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
