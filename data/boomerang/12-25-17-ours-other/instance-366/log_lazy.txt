ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Currently, blocks B, C, and D are on the table. Block A is placed on top of block C. All blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks at the moment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block B is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial attempt in this environment, there are no prior errors or feedback to reflect on. The starting state provides a clear description of the positions of the blocks and indicates which actions are valid, such as picking up blocks B and D directly from the table, and unstacking block A from block C.

Think: To achieve the goal state where B is on top of C, and D is on top of B, the following steps should be considered:
1. Unstack block A from block C, as block C needs to be clear to have block B placed on it.
2. Put down block A on the table since it doesn't have a specified position in the goal state.
3. Pick up block B and stack it on block C.
4. Pick up block D and stack it on block B.

This plan will rearrange the blocks to match the desired goal state configuration. Each action chosen is currently valid and logically progresses towards the goal.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,c:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,c:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,b:default)"]
