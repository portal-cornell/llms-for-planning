ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A and block C are on the table. Block B is positioned on top of block C. Both blocks A and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is empty at this moment, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks such that block 'b' is on top of block 'a', and block 'a' is on top of block 'c'. This configuration must be achieved using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks with the help of the robot hand.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback to reflect on, as this is the initial attempt to reach the goal state. The goal is to have block B on top of block A, and block A on top of block C. 

Think: Given the starting state, block B is already on block C, which is a part of the desired final configuration, except that block A needs to be between them. To achieve the goal:
1. Unstack block B from block C and put it down on the table.
2. Pick up block A and stack it on block C.
3. Pick up block B from the table and stack it on block A.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,c:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)"]
