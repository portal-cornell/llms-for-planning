ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. The current configuration of the blocks is as follows: Block A is on the table, Block B is directly on top of Block A, and Block C is directly on top of Block B. The robot's hand is empty, and Block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. This setup indicates that the blocks are stacked in a single column, with Block C accessible for manipulation by the robot.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand, a set of blocks, and a table. The blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed directly on the table. A block is considered "clear" if there is nothing on top of it. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block A is on top of block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
As this is the first sequence of actions, there is no previous feedback to reflect upon. We start with a clear understanding of the Blocksworld rules and constraints.

Think:
The goal is to have Block A on top of Block B. Initially, the blocks are stacked with C on top of B, and B on top of A. To achieve the goal state, we first need to access Block A, which means unstacking the blocks above it. The robot hand is initially empty, which allows us to use the unstack action. Following the unstacking, our strategy should involve rearranging the blocks to achieve the desired configuration.

Action Sequence:
unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
