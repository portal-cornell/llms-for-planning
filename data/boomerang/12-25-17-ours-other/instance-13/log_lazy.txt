ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot's hand are as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is also on the table.
- Block c is stacked on top of block b and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of block c.
- Block d is stacked on top of block a and is clear as well.
- The robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any block.

This setup provides a clear view of the state of each block and the status of the robot's hand, crucial for planning the next actions in the Blocksworld domain.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)
Goal State:
The goal in the current environment is to have block A positioned on top of block B.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
As this is the initial attempt to find a sequence of actions to reach the goal state from the starting state, there is no prior error feedback or visited states to reflect upon. I need to carefully consider the valid actions and the current configuration of blocks to formulate an effective plan.

Think: 
The goal is to stack block a on block b. From the starting state:
- Block c is on b, which needs to be moved to make b clear.
- Block d is on a and needs to be moved to pick up a later.
- The robot's hand is empty, which is suitable for picking up blocks.

Given the valid actions of unstacking blocks c from b and d from a, the sequence should initially focus on clearing these blocks. After unstacking, the robot can then manipulate block a to achieve the goal.

Action Sequence:
unstack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,b:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "unstack(d:default,a:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)"]
