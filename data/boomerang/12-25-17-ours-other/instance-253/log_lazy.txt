ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration of these blocks and their positions are as follows:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is on top of block d, and there is nothing on top of block b, making it clear.
- Block c is also on the table and is clear, with no other blocks on top of it.
- Block d is on top of block a.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating that it is not currently holding any block.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks in a specific order where block B is on top of block C, block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration needs to be achieved using a series of actions such as picking up and putting down blocks, or stacking and unstacking them, by the robot hand in the environment.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: As this is the initial attempt at solving the problem, there is no prior feedback or action history to reflect upon. The primary focus is to carefully analyze the starting state against the goal state and determine an optimal sequence of actions.

Think: The goal state requires a tower with the order A, D, C, B from bottom to top. Initially, A is at the bottom with D on top, which partially aligns with the goal state. Therefore, the primary tasks involve moving B and C into the correct positions. Since the robot's hand is empty, and block B is clear but on top of D, it can be immediately moved. Block C is also clear and can be directly manipulated. The actions should focus on rearranging B and C without disrupting the already correctly placed A and D.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,d:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,d:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,d:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,c:default)"]
