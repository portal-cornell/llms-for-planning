ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Blocks A, B, and D are placed directly on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
- Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup is part of a task where the goal might involve rearranging these blocks into a different configuration using the robot hand.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to place block C on top of block B. This arrangement will require careful planning and execution, potentially involving actions such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to achieve the desired configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the initial sequence, there are no prior actions or errors to reflect upon. The starting state clearly shows the positions of the blocks, and the goal state requires Block C to be on top of Block B. I need to plan a sequence that minimally disrupts the current configuration and directly accomplishes the goal.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking Block C on top of Block B, I should follow these steps:
1. Unstack Block C from Block D, as Block C is not yet in a position to be directly moved to Block B.
2. Put down Block C on the table to free up the robot's hand.
3. Pick up Block C from the table.
4. Stack Block C on Block B, as per the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 4
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)"]
