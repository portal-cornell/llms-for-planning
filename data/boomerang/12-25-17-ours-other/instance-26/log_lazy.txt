ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, blocks A, B, and D are on the table. Block C is on top of block D. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on them. The robot hand is empty at the moment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
The environment consists of a robot hand, a set of blocks, and a table. The blocks can either be positioned on top of other blocks or directly on the table. Each block that is not covered by another block is considered clear. The robot hand can either hold a single block or be empty. The goal for the agent in this scenario is to rearrange the blocks so that block 'a' is on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is on top of block 'a'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: 
Since this is the initial action proposal and there is no error feedback, there is no need for reflection based on previous errors. We need to move from the starting state where blocks A, B, and D are on the table, block C is on top of block D, and all blocks A, B, and C are clear. The robot hand is empty. The goal is to have block A on top of block B, and block C on top of block A.

Think: 
To achieve the goal state from the starting state, the following steps should be considered:
1. Remove block C from block D since it needs to eventually be placed on block A.
2. Place block A on block B as per the goal configuration.
3. Finally, stack block C on top of block A.

To do this, the robot hand must first pick up or unstack block C, then work towards the configuration of A on B, and finally stack C on A.

Action Sequence: 
unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]

Optimal plan: ["pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,b:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
