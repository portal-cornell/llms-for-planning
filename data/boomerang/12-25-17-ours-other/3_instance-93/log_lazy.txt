ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the provided environment, there are three objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All these blocks are currently on the table. Each of these blocks, 'a', 'b', and 'c', is clear, meaning that no other block is stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating that it is not currently holding any block. The setup is ideal for initiating actions like picking up any block since all are accessible and the hand is free.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld scenario, the goal for the robot is to arrange block C on top of block A. This objective involves manipulating a set of blocks and possibly utilizing a table and the robotâ€™s hand to achieve this specific configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Given the initial state, all blocks 'a', 'b', and 'c' are on the table and clear, and the robot's hand is empty. The goal is to have block 'c' on top of block 'a'. This will require a sequence of picking up and stacking actions.

Think: The most straightforward approach would involve picking up block 'c', since it needs to be stacked on block 'a'. After picking up 'c', 'a' will still be accessible to stack 'c' upon. This approach avoids unnecessary moves and directly aligns with the goal state requirements.

Action Sequence: pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 3
Total edges expanded: 2
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
