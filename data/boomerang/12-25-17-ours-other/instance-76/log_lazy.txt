ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are arranged as follows: Block A is clear and directly on top of Block B, which is on the table. Block C is clear and placed on top of Block D, which rests on the table. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup allows the robot to manipulate the blocks, either by picking up clear blocks or by stacking and unstacking them to achieve a desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In the environment, there are blocks labeled (a, b, c, d) and a table. The robot hand can manipulate these blocks. Currently, the goal is to arrange block b on top of block a and block d on top of block c.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: In this initial step, there were no previous actions or error feedback provided. Thus, the reflection phase focuses on understanding the current state and the goal state accurately to formulate an effective plan.

Think: The goal is to have B on top of A and D on top of C. In the starting state, A is on top of B and C is on top of D. Therefore, the blocks need to be rearranged to meet the goal state:
1. Unstack Block A from Block B.
2. Put Block A down on the table.
3. Pick up Block B.
4. Stack Block B on top of Block A.
5. Unstack Block C from Block D.
6. Put Block C down on the table.
7. Pick up Block D.
8. Stack Block D on top of Block C.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,a:default)", "unstack(c:default,d:default)", "put-down(c:default)", "pick-up(d:default)", "stack(d:default,c:default)"]
