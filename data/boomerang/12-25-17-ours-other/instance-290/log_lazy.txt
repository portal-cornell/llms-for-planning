ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A is placed on block D, and block B, block C, and block D are directly on the table. Blocks B, A, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is empty at the moment, indicating it is not holding any block. This setup shows that the blocks are arranged with some on the table and one on another block, with the robot hand available to manipulate them as required.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current objective is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is positioned on top of block 'c', and block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'd'. This setup involves using actions to manipulate the blocks to achieve the desired configuration.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
No prior actions or error feedback have been provided, so this is the initial attempt to achieve the goal state. The goal is to have block A on block C, and block B on block D.

Think:
The starting state has block A on D, with B and C on the table. The goal state requires A on C and B on D. The robot's hand is empty, which allows it to manipulate blocks. The sequence should:
1. Unstack A from D (since A needs to be moved).
2. Put down A on the table (to clear the robot's hand).
3. Pick up B (to prepare to stack it on D).
4. Stack B on D (as required by the goal).
5. Pick up A from the table (to place it on C).
6. Stack A on C (to achieve the final part of the goal).

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,d:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,d:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 7
Total edges expanded: 6
Optimal plan: ["unstack(a:default,d:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)", "pick-up(b:default)", "stack(b:default,d:default)"]
