ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the configuration of the blocks and the state of the robot hand:

- Block B is on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block B, and Block A is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
- Block C is also on the table.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block C, and Block D is clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty, ready to manipulate blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block C, and block C is, in turn, on top of block B. This configuration requires careful stacking maneuvers using a robot hand, which can pick up and stack blocks, or unstack and put them down as needed to achieve the desired arrangement.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: This is the first interaction in this environment, so there is no error feedback or previous states to reflect on. The current state has blocks A on B, and D on C, with the robot hand empty. The goal is to have A on C and C on B.

Think: To achieve the goal state from the starting state, a sequence of actions will involve rearranging blocks A, B, C, and D. First, we need to clear the top blocks from B and C. Then, we can re-stack them according to the goal. Block D needs to be temporarily moved to allow C to be moved under A.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 9
Total edges expanded: 8
Optimal plan: ["unstack(d:default,c:default)", "put-down(d:default)", "unstack(a:default,b:default)", "stack(a:default,d:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,b:default)", "unstack(a:default,d:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)"]
