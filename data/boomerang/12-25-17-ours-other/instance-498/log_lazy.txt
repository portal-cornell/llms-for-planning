ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current scenario, the environment consists of five blocks labeled A, B, C, D, and E, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is a summary of the situation:

1. Blocks A, B, and D are positioned on the table.
2. Block C is stacked on top of Block D.
3. Block E is stacked on top of Block B.
4. Blocks A, C, and E are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
5. The robot hand is empty, ready to perform an action.

This layout sets the stage for operations such as moving blocks or stacking them differently using the robot hand.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
- unstack(e:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks so that block A is on top of block E, block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect:
Given the current environment setup and the goal state, I need to carefully plan the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired configuration. Since the robot hand is empty, it can perform pick-up or unstack actions. The goal configuration requires stacking blocks in a specific order, which involves multiple steps of unstacking and then stacking the blocks correctly.

Think:
1. I need to make Block E clear to place Block A on it. Since Block E currently has Block A on top, I don't need to move Block A.
2. Block C needs to be on Block B, so I will need to unstack Block C from Block D and then stack it on Block B.
3. Finally, Block D needs to be on Block A, which requires moving Block D after Block A is already on Block E.

Action Sequence:
- unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(d:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(e:default,b:default), put-down(e:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,e:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)

Error Feedback: The action '-unstack(c:default,d:default)' at index 0 was invalid. Below are the actions that were valid at that state:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(c:default,d:default)
- unstack(e:default,b:default)

ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The error feedback indicates that the action 'unstack(c:default,d:default)' was formatted incorrectly with a leading hyphen, which made it invalid. It's important to ensure that the action commands are exactly as specified, without any additional characters or formatting errors.

Think: The goal is to achieve a configuration where A is on top of E, C is on top of B, and D is on top of A. Starting with valid moves, I need to carefully choose actions that lead to this arrangement without unnecessary moves. Since the robot's hand is empty, I can start by unstacking blocks that need to be moved according to the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,d:default), put-down(c:default), unstack(e:default,b:default), put-down(e:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,e:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,a:default)
