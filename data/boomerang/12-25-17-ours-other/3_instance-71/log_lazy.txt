ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Block A and Block B are placed directly on the table. Block C is situated on top of Block A. Both Block B and Block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is currently empty and not holding any of the blocks.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the objective is to rearrange the blocks so that block B is positioned on top of block A.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The initial state has Block C on top of Block A, and Block B is clear on the table. The robot hand is empty, which allows for picking up a block or unstacking Block C from Block A. The goal is to have Block B on top of Block A, which requires Block C to be moved elsewhere first.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the first step is to free up Block A by moving Block C. Since Block C is on Block A and the hand is empty, I can use the unstack action to move Block C from Block A and hold it. Next, with Block A clear, I can pick up Block B and stack it on Block A. Finally, I must place Block C back down on the table to ensure all blocks are stable and the robot hand is empty.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)
