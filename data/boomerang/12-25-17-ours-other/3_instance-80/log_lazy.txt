ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The block 'a' is placed on the table, and block 'b' is positioned on top of block 'a'. Block 'c' is also on the table. Both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup indicates a scenario where block 'b' is stacked on block 'a', while block 'c' remains separate and clear on the table, with the robot hand available for further actions.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the objective is to arrange block A on top of block C.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first action sequence for this scenario, there is no prior feedback to reflect upon. I need to plan a sequence that uses only valid actions to transition from the starting state to the goal state, where block 'a' should be on top of block 'c'.

Think: In the starting state, the robot hand is empty, block 'b' is on top of block 'a', and block 'c' is clear on the table. The goal is to have block 'a' on top of block 'c'. To achieve this:
1. Unstack 'b' from 'a' to clear 'a'.
2. Place 'b' back on the table.
3. Pick up 'a'.
4. Stack 'a' on top of 'c'.
This plan avoids unnecessary manipulation of 'c' since it is already in a clear state on the table.

Action Sequence: unstack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default), stack(a:default,c:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["unstack(b:default,a:default)", "put-down(b:default)", "pick-up(a:default)", "stack(a:default,c:default)"]
