ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In this Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Here's the current setup:
- Block B is on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block B.
- Block C is also on the table.
Both Block A and Block C are clear, meaning there's nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it's not currently holding any block. This setup allows the robot to either pick up a clear block or manipulate the blocks based on the desired goal configuration.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is for block C to be positioned on top of block A. This objective is part of a setting where various blocks may be rearranged using actions such as picking up and stacking blocks, or unstacking and putting down blocks by a robot hand. The robot can manipulate one block at a time, either holding it or placing it on another block or back on the table. The intention is to achieve the desired configuration from the current state of the blocks.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback, which means this is the initial attempt to sequence actions from the current state to the goal state. The goal is to have block C on top of block A. From the starting state, block A is not immediately accessible to be used as a base for block C because it is under block B.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the robot hand must first make block A accessible by removing block B from on top of it. This can be done by unstacking block A from B. After block A is clear, the robot can then manipulate block C. Since the robot's hand is empty, the first action can be to unstack block A from B. After placing block A down (since block C needs to go on top of it), the robot can pick up block C and stack it on block A.

Action Sequence: unstack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)



Reached goal: True
Action sequence: ["unstack(a:default,b:default)", "put-down(a:default)", "pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
Total nodes expanded: 5
Total edges expanded: 4
Optimal plan: ["pick-up(c:default)", "stack(c:default,a:default)"]
