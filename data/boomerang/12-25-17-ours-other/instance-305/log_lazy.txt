ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the current configuration and status of each component:

- Block a is clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block b is also on the table, but has block c on top of it.
- Block c has block d on top of it, making block c not clear.
- Block d is clear, indicating that no other block is placed on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a stack starting from block b on the table, then block c above b, and block d at the top. Block a is independently on the table with no other blocks on top.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to achieve a configuration where block B is on top of block A and block D is on top of block B. This setup requires the blocks to be arranged in a vertical sequence with block A at the bottom, followed by block B, and block D at the top.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current configuration has blocks b, c, and d in a vertical stack, and block a is separate on the table. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that block a supports block b, and block b supports block d. Notably, block c is not mentioned in the goal state, indicating it might be irrelevant or simply needs to be moved out of the way.

Think: To achieve the goal state, the first step is to clear block b since block d is currently on top of it. We can start by unstacking block d from block c. Once block d is in the robot hand, we can choose between placing it directly on block b or setting it aside (e.g., on the table or on block a temporarily). Given the final goal, placing it on block b directly after clearing block b seems efficient. Therefore, we need to first unstack block c from block b. After block c is unstacked, block b will be clear to support block d. We'll also need to handle block a accordingly, but since block a is already clear and on the table, it can be directly used to support block b after block b is clear.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(c:default,b:default), put-down(c:default), pick-up(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,b:default)
