ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current state of the environment, there are three objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'c' is positioned on top of block 'a'.
- Block 'b' is also on the table and it has no other blocks on top, making it clear.
- Block 'c' is clear as there are no blocks on top of it.
- Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. 

This setup describes the starting conditions of the blocks and the status of the robot hand in the environment.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)
Goal State:
In the environment, there are blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be either placed on other blocks or on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it. The robot hand can either hold a block or be empty. The current goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block 'c' is on top of block 'b'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: Since this is the first sequence of actions, there is no prior error feedback to reflect upon. The initial state shows that the blocks 'a' and 'b' are on the table, while block 'c' is on top of block 'a'. Block 'b' and 'c' are clear, and the robot hand is empty. The goal is to have 'c' on 'b'.

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking block 'c' on block 'b', the sequence should involve moving 'c' from its current position on 'a' to 'b'. Initially, the robot should unstack 'c' from 'a', then since 'b' is clear and on the table, the robot should stack 'c' on 'b'. This process requires the robot's hand to be free to perform these actions, which it currently is.

Action Sequence: unstack(c:default,a:default), stack(c:default,b:default)
