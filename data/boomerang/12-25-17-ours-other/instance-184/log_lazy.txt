ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block B is directly on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block C.
- Block C is directly on the table.

Furthermore, both Block D and Block A are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as picking up any clear block or manipulating the blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: The current state involves blocks A and D being clear while B and C support blocks D and A respectively. The goal is to arrange the blocks in a stack where C is on top of A, and A is on top of B. To achieve this, we need to unstack blocks properly and restack them in the correct order.

Think: Since the robot's hand is empty, the first step should be to unstack D from B. Once D is in the robot's hand, it can be placed on the table. Subsequently, block A will need to be unstacked from C and placed on B. After block A is on B, block C can be picked up and stacked on block A to meet the goal state.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(a:default,c:default), stack(a:default,b:default), pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)
