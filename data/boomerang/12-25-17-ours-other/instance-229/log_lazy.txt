ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL PROMPT
--------------------


States Visited:

Starting State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here's the configuration of these objects:

- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Blocks A and C are on the table.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Blocks D and A are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that Block D is stacked on Block B, which itself is stacked on Block C, while Blocks A and C are directly on the table. Additionally, since the robot hand is empty, it is available to perform operations like picking up a block.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the goal is to arrange block 'd' on top of block 'c'.


ACTION PLAN PROPOSAL RESPONSE
--------------------

Reflect: There is no error feedback, thus the previous action sequence is not applicable. The environment is a classical Blocksworld domain where the robotâ€™s task is to rearrange blocks to achieve a specific configuration. Currently, Block D is on top of Block B, which is on top of Block C. Block A and Block C are on the table. To reach the goal of having block D on Block C, adjustments to the stack are necessary.

Think: To get Block D on top of Block C, the following steps should be considered:
1. Unstack Block D from Block B since this is the only action to start moving D without violating the rules (only clear blocks can be picked up or unstacked).
2. Block B will be clear after unstacking D; thus, putting Block D directly on Block C isn't immediately possible as Block C is not clear.
3. Put down Block D on the table to clear the robot's hand.
4. Unstack Block B from Block C to make Block C a viable base to place Block D.
5. Put down Block B on the table as it is no longer needed in the stack.
6. Pick up Block D from the table.
7. Stack Block D on Block C to achieve the goal configuration.

Action Sequence: unstack(d:default,b:default), put-down(d:default), unstack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default), pick-up(d:default), stack(d:default,c:default)
