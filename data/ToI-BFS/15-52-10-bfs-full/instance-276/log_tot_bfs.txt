ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- pick-up(d:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d, and here is their configuration:

- The robot hand is holding block a.
- Block b is positioned on top of block c.
- Both blocks c and d are on the table.
- Blocks b and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. 

This setup is part of a scenario where the goal is typically to rearrange these blocks into a different configuration using a series of specified actions.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block a being held by the robot hand, block b on top of block c, and blocks c and d on the table with b and d clear. The goal state requires a stack where A is on C, B is on D, and D is on A, forming a circular stack which is physically impossible because a block cannot be both under and on top of the same block at the same time. Thus, the goal state as described cannot be achieved from the current state or any state.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The scenario is set up with block 'd' being held by the robot's hand. Block 'a' is positioned on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is in turn on top of block 'c'. Block 'c' is resting on the table. Additionally, block 'a' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. This setup provides a clear view of the arrangement of the blocks and the status of the robot’s hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot is holding block 'd' while block 'a' is stacked on top of 'b', which is on 'c', resting on the table. The goal state requires a configuration where A is on C, B on D, and D on A, forming a loop configuration. The current state is markedly different from the goal, as it not only lacks the loop configuration but also has blocks in a linear arrangement. The robot's hand holding block 'd' suggests an intermediate state, possibly transitioning towards rearranging the blocks. However, due to the complexity and difference in structure between the current and goal states, it is unclear if the current state is definitively on the path to achieving the goal without more context on the steps being taken.

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d, and here is their configuration:

Goal State:

This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, where block A needs to be on top of block C, the immediate need is to place block A on the table as the hand is currently occupied and A should be eventually stacked on C, which currently has B on top of it. The action put-down(a:default) is necessary to free the robot's hand and make A available for future stacking. After putting A down, the robot hand will be free to manipulate other blocks like picking up B to eventually rearrange them as required in the goal.

Actions: put-down(a:default), pick-up(b:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 PROMPT

Error Feedback: Action 'pick-up(b:default)' is not a valid action for the current state.

This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block A to be on top of block C and block B on top of block D, with block D on top of block A, which is a circular dependency and seems incorrect or impossible. Assuming a more feasible interpretation is needed, such as A on C, and B on D (ignoring the part about D on A), the current possession of block A by the robot hand allows for immediate stacking actions. Since block C is not clear, stacking A on C directly is not possible yet. However, block D is clear and can be used as an intermediary step. The first action could involve placing block A on block D to clear hand and subsequently move block B.

Actions: stack(a:default,d:default), put-down(a:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The state of these blocks is described as follows:

- Block A is on top of Block B and it is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of Block A.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block C is directly on the table.
- Block D is also directly on the table and clear, with nothing on top of it.

Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup depicts a scenario where blocks are stacked in a specific configuration and the robot has the capacity to interact with these blocks to rearrange them as needed.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state specified requires a specific configuration where block A is on top of block C, block B on top of block D, and block D on top of block A. This is an impossible configuration as it describes a circular arrangement (A on C, B on D, D on A) that cannot exist in a physical environment where each block can only be in one place at a time. Given the current state, where blocks A, B, C, and D are arranged linearly without forming any loops, there is no sequence of moves (pick-up, put-down, stack, unstack) that can lead to the described goal state. The impossibility primarily arises from the logical inconsistency in the described goal rather than the current arrangement of blocks.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The current configuration of these blocks and their relationship with the table and the robot's hand is as follows:

- Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block A is stacked on top of Block B.
- Block C is placed directly on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.
- Block D is on top of Block A.
- Block B is on top of Block C.

This setup involves a vertical arrangement where Block D is at the top, directly above Block A, which is itself above Block B, and Block B is stacked on Block C, which rests on the table.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows a configuration where Block D is directly on top of Block A, and Block A is on top of Block B, with Block B on top of Block C. The goal state requires Block A on top of Block C, Block B on top of Block D, and Block D on top of Block A. The current configuration has no direct paths to the goal without significant rearrangement, as Block D needs to be beneath Block B, which is not the case currently. The robot will need to perform multiple unstacking and restacking actions to rearrange the blocks into the desired configuration.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently:
- Block D and Block C are on the table.
- Block A is placed on top of Block D, and Block B is on top of Block C.
- Both Block A and Block B are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The goal state involves a configuration where block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. The current state has block A on top of block D and block B on top of block C, and both blocks A and B are clear. However, the described goal state is logically impossible as it requires block D to be both directly on the table and on top of block A simultaneously, which contradicts the rules of the Blocksworld environment where a block can only be in one location at a time. Therefore, the current state cannot be on the path to the described goal state as the goal itself is unattainable.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In this environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, blocks A, C, and D are directly on the table. Block B is stacked on top of block C. Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks at the moment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block A is on top of block C, block B is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block A. This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks A, C, and D on the table with B stacked on C. To reach the goal state where A is on C, B on D, and D on A, several moves are necessary. The configuration in the goal state is not currently feasible because it requires block D to be both on the table (under B) and under block A simultaneously, which is impossible. This indicates a logical error or misunderstanding in the goal state description.

VALUE PROMPT 1

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The scenario is set up with block 'd' being held by the robot's hand. Block 'a' is positioned on top of block 'b', and block 'b' is in turn on top of block 'c'. Block 'c' is resting on the table. Additionally, block 'a' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

This configuration represents a specific stacking order that needs to be achieved through a series of moves using the available actions: picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking and unstacking them.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block 'd' held by the robot's hand, and a stack of blocks 'a' on 'b' on 'c', with 'c' on the table. The goal state requires an arrangement that forms a circular stack with 'A' on 'C', 'B' on 'D', and 'D' on 'A', creating a loop. Given the current state, reaching the described goal state is fundamentally impossible since such a circular arrangement (A on C, B on D, D on A) cannot exist stably in a physical environment or within the typical rules of the Blocksworld game, where each block can only be directly on top of one other block and under one at most.
