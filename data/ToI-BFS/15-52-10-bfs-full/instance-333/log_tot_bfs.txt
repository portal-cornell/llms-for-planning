Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks A, B, and C are placed directly on the table, while block D is on top of block B. The blocks A, C, and D are clear, indicating that no other blocks are stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up a block or stacking one block onto another.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, we need to start by making block B available for stacking. Currently, block D is on top of block B, so the first action should be to unstack D from B. After block D is removed, block B will be clear and ready for further actions. For the second action, since block C is already on the table and clear, picking up block B will prepare us to subsequently stack it on block C in a future step.

Actions: unstack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(b:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, the current action should involve manipulating block D, since it's currently on top of block B and needs to be free to later achieve the goal of having block A on block D. The robot hand is empty, so the immediate action can involve unstacking block D from B. Following this, picking up block A seems logical as it prepares for the eventual stacking of A on D.

Actions: unstack(d:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Blocks A, B, and C are on the table and each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot hand is currently holding block D.

This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has all blocks except D clear and on the table, with the robot hand holding block D. To achieve the goal state, block D must first be put down, likely on the table, to clear the robot's hand. Then, blocks B and C can be stacked (B on C), and subsequently, block D can be stacked on block B. Finally, block A can be placed on block D to complete the arrangement. The current state allows for these actions to be performed in sequence, suggesting it is on a feasible path toward the goal state.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Block d is placed on top of block b, and the robot hand is currently holding block a. Block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. Block c is on the table and is also clear, indicating no other blocks are stacked on it. Similarly, block b is on the table. This setup is part of a scenario where the robot interacts with these blocks, performing actions like stacking and unstacking, and manipulating them based on their positions and clearances.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block d on top of block b and the robot hand holding block a, with block c on the table and clear. To reach the goal state, block a needs to be on block d, block b on c, and d on b. The current setup already has d on b, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, block a is in the robot's hand and will need to be placed down or directly stacked, and block b will need to be moved onto block c. Since part of the current state aligns with the goal state (block d on b), and there are clear blocks and feasible moves to rearrange the others, the current state could be on the path to achieving the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, it is essential to start by placing block D in a position that allows further actions to set up the desired configuration. Since block D needs to eventually be beneath block B, the logical step would be to first place block D on the table to free the robot's hand, which will allow for subsequent actions to manipulate other blocks.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Since the robot hand is currently holding block D and the goal is to have block A on block D, block B on block C, and block D on block B, the first logical step is to place block D in a position that leads towards achieving this arrangement. The desired end position for block D is on block B, as per the goal state. Therefore, the first action should be to stack block D on block B. After this, block D will be in the correct position relative to block B.

The next step would involve working towards placing block B on block C. However, since direct action to manipulate block B is not currently available, I must consider actions that prepare for future placements. Since block B will end up on top of block C, block C needs to remain clear until block B is moved. Therefore, the immediate action after placing D on B would be to pick up block A, preparing it to be placed on block D, aligning with part of the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have a configuration where A is on D, B is on C, and D is on B. Given that the robot is currently holding block D, the immediate options are to place D down on the table or stack it on top of another block. To move towards the goal configuration, it would be beneficial to place D directly on block B because it aligns with the final goal of D being on B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, we need to start by placing block D in a position where it can be used to support block A. Given the robot hand is currently holding block D and the valid actions include stacking D on top of A, B, or C, the best option is to stack D on B. This action will align with the part of the goal that requires D to be on B. After stacking D on B, the next action should ideally position another block to progress towards the goal. Since block A needs to be on D and D is now on B, the next logical step would be to pick up block A in preparation for stacking it on D, but since picking up A is not a valid action currently, we need to wait for further valid actions to be updated in the next state.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has the blocks A, B, and C on the table with D stacked on B. The goal is to have A on D, D on B, and B on C. It's clear that some reconfiguration is needed. Since D is already on B, this part aligns with the goal state where D should eventually support A. However, the robot will need to move block D after placing B on C and then stack A on D. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it allows for immediate action without needing to put down any held block. The current state offers a reasonable starting point for achieving the goal state, though several moves are required.

Think: The current state shows all blocks (A, B, C, D) on the table and clear, with the robot hand empty. This setup is a typical starting configuration in Blocksworld, providing maximum flexibility for any block manipulation sequence. To reach the goal state where A on D, B on C, and D on B, the robot will need to execute a series of stacking actions. Given that all blocks are clear and accessible, the robot can directly initiate the necessary moves to reach the goal configuration. The initial position does not preclude any of the goal conditions and logically allows for an efficient progression toward the goal state.

Think: The current state has block d on block b and block a on block d, which aligns with part of the goal state where block a needs to be on block d. However, block b should be on block c according to the goal state, but currently, block c is on the table and clear. Therefore, the configuration will require moving blocks to align with the goal state, particularly involving moving block b onto block c. The robot's hand being empty is advantageous as it allows for immediate action without needing to put down a block first.

Think: In the current state, block D is already on top of block B, which is one part of the goal state configuration. However, the desired final stacking also requires block A to be on top of block D and block B to be on top of block C. The robot's hand being empty is beneficial as it allows for immediate action to rearrange the blocks. The next steps would involve unstacking block D from B, rearranging block C as necessary, and then proceeding with stacking as per the goal configuration. Given that one part of the goal state is already achieved (D on B), and the robot hand is free to start operations, it suggests a good potential to progress towards the goal.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, I need to consider a sequence of actions that progressively builds towards this configuration. Starting from the current state where all blocks are clear on the table and the robot hand is empty, the first logical step is to begin manipulating the blocks that will form the base of the required stacks. Picking up block D seems a prudent first action, as it needs to ultimately support block A and be on top of block B. Next, picking up block C is sensible because it serves as a base for placing block B on it.

Think: The current state shows that blocks A, B, and C are clear on the table, and the robot hand is holding block D. To reach the goal state where block A is on D, B on C, and D on B, several steps are required. First, block D needs to be put down, potentially on the table or directly on B. Following that, B can be picked up and placed on C. Then, D should be picked up again and placed on top of B, and finally, A can be picked and stacked on D. The current state, with all blocks being clear except for D being held, provides a good starting point because the robot can immediately begin to manipulate the blocks towards the desired configuration without needing to clear any blocks first.

Think: In the given current state, block C is already in the robot's hand, which is a necessary step towards stacking it on another block, as required in the goal. Blocks A, B, and D are clear and on the table, which allows for easy stacking without needing to unstack them first. The goal state requires block D to be on block B and block B to be on block C. To achieve this, the robot can put down block C and then pick up block B to stack on C. Afterwards, block D can be picked up and stacked on the B-C stack. Finally, block A can be picked up and stacked on block D. The current state clearly facilitates the sequence of actions needed to reach the goal state.

VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state features block d atop block b, with block a also on the table, and block c being held by the robot's hand. To achieve the goal state, where block a is on block d, block b is on block c, and block d is on block b, the following steps need to be considered:
- Block c needs to be put down on the table to eventually stack block b on top of it.
- Block d needs to be unstacked from block b to allow block b to be placed on block c.
- Finally, block a must be stacked on block d after it is placed correctly above block b.

In the current configuration, the robot holding block c is a positive step towards reordering the blocks as it can place block c down first, setting the sequence for stacking block b on it. However, block d is already stacked on block b, which complicates the direct placement of block b on block c without additional moves. The arrangement of block a and block d is not yet begun, but the robot's current state of holding block c neither advances nor regresses the final goal configuration significantly.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is on D, B is on C, and D is on B, we need to start by setting up a foundation for this configuration. Since block C is currently held by the robot hand, and the goal requires B to be on C, a sensible first step would be to put down block C, either directly on the table or on top of another block that aligns with our goal. However, since block B eventually needs to be on C, placing C on B immediately does not align with the goal as B should be on top of C. Instead, the optimal first action is to put down C on the table to make it available for stacking B on it later.

The second action to consider is preparing the placement of D since the goal has D on B. Currently, D is clear on the table, so no immediate action with D is required. Therefore, the second action could be either preparing another block for future moves or repositioning C for better alignment when stacking later. Given the available valid actions and considering future strategic moves, the second action could involve rethinking the position of C for an optimal setup in the next steps. However, as per the valid actions, the next immediate beneficial action isn't directly clear without repositioning another block first.

Think: The current state shows all blocks A, B, C, and D clear and on the table, with the robot hand empty. This is a typical starting configuration for many Blocksworld problems and provides a flexible base for achieving various configurations, including the described goal state. The described goal requires stacking A on D, B on C, and D on B, which involves multiple moves including picking up and stacking actions. Given that all blocks are clear and accessible, and the robot hand is free to start operations, the current state is conducive for progressing towards this goal. However, reaching the goal state from the current configuration will require a correct sequence of actions, and there is still work to be done to ensure that the blocks are stacked in the correct order without violating the constraints of having blocks on top of others during the process.

2. The robot hand is currently empty, not holding any blocks.
3. Blocks B, A, and D are all on the table, indicating they are not stacked on any other blocks.
4. Block C is on top of Block B, and C is also clear, meaning no blocks are on top of C.
5. Block A is clear, with no other blocks on top of it.

This setup establishes that Blocks A, C, and D are clear and can be moved or manipulated by the robot. Block B is under Block C, restricting its movement until Block C is moved.

Think: The current state suggests that all blocks except Block B are clear and the robot hand is empty, which is a good starting point for manipulation. The goal is to have A on D, B on C, and D on B. Since D is clear and on the table, the first task could be to stack D on B, which aligns with the goal state requirements. However, since C is currently on B, C needs to be moved before D can be placed on B. Following that, B can be placed on C and finally A on D. The current setup allows manipulation towards the goal as no blocks are in a final or fixed state that would prevent future required moves.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state presents a configuration where block D is on block A, and blocks B and C are on the table with nothing on them. The robot hand is empty. To reach the goal state where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, significant manipulation of blocks is required. The robot will need to unstack block D from block A and then rearrange the blocks according to the goal state. The desired goal state is complex but achievable from the current state with a series of correct actions including unstacking and stacking in proper order.

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block D is on top of block C and nowhere else. Blocks B, A, and C are directly on the table. Blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the blocks are mostly on the table except for block D which is on top of block C. The goal state requires a specific stack with A on D, B on C, and D on B. To reach the goal state from the current state, the robot hand must first unstack block D from C. Then, it must rearrange the blocks to achieve the stacking sequence as specified in the goal. Given that the robot hand is currently empty and the blocks are positioned in a manageable way, it is feasible to execute a series of actions to transition from the current state to the goal state.

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the given environment, there are four objects identified as blocks: A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks and their relationship with the environment are described by the following predicates:

1. Block D is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of D.
2. The robot hand is currently empty, not holding any blocks.
3. Blocks B, A, and D are all on the table, indicating they are not stacked on any other blocks.
4. Block C is on top of Block B, and C is also clear, meaning no blocks are on top of C.
5. Block A is clear, with no other blocks on top of it.

This setup establishes that Blocks A, C, and D are clear and can be moved or manipulated by the robot. Block B is under Block C, restricting its movement until Block C is moved.
Valid Actions:
- unstack(c:default,b:default)
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(d:default)
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state, where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, the first step should be to clear block B, as it is currently under block C. This requires moving block C from its current position. The valid action available to initiate this is to unstack block C from block B. After unstacking C, placing it somewhere clear such as the table will open up possibilities for future reconfigurations, though the specific action to place C isn't directly stated in the valid actions. Given the valid actions, I will choose to pick up block A next, preparing it for a future stacking action.

Actions: unstack(c:default,b:default), pick-up(a:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block A. Blocks B, C, and D are all on the table. Blocks B, C, and D are also clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them, allowing them to be accessed or moved by the robot.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows the robot hand holding block A, and all other blocks (B, C, D) are clear on the table. To achieve the goal state where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, the robot must first put down block A to free its hand. The goal state configuration is complex, requiring multiple stacking actions. Since block A is already in the robot's hand, the robot can directly move towards placing A on D once the prerequisite condition (D on B and B on C) is met. This suggests that the current state can progress towards the goal state through a series of strategic moves.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

1. Block A is on the table and there is nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is being held by the robot hand.
3. Block C is on the table and is also clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
4. Block D is on the table and is clear as well.

This setup indicates that all blocks except for B are on the table and clear, while block B is currently in the grasp of the robot hand.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block B in the robot hand, while blocks A, C, and D are clear on the table. The goal requires stacking blocks in a specific configuration: A on D, B on C, and D on B. The robot holding B is advantageous, as it can directly stack B on C, which is one of the required moves. However, achieving the full goal state from the current situation requires additional steps to correctly position A and D. The state is not immediately ready for a direct transition to the goal state, but it is on a potential path where further actions like stacking and unstacking can lead to the goal configuration.

VALUE PROMPT 3

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The blocks A, B, and D are positioned on the table. Block C is currently being held by the robot hand. Additionally, the tops of blocks A, B, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of them.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block C is held by the robot hand, while blocks A, B, and D are on the table and clear. To reach the goal state where A is on D, B is on C, and D is on B, the robot can begin by putting down block C and then manipulating other blocks to stack as required. Since block C needs to be under block B, the first action could be to put C down on the table. Subsequent actions would involve picking up and stacking blocks in the correct order to achieve the desired final configuration. The current state allows for these actions to be executed since all necessary blocks are accessible and can be manipulated freely.

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the current configuration and status of the blocks and the robot's hand are as follows:

1. The robot is currently holding block A.
2. Block D is clear and placed on the table.
3. Block C is on top of block B and is also clear.
4. Both blocks B and D are on the table.

This setting represents a snapshot of the environment involving four blocks (A, B, C, D) with specific positions and conditions that affect the possible actions the robot can perform next.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot is holding block A, which can be beneficial as one of the goals is to place A on D. Block D is clear and on the table, making it immediately available for block A to be stacked upon. However, block B is also on the table, and C is on top of B. For the goal of having B on C and D on B, the positions of B, C, and D will need to be rearranged. The current arrangement might be on a path that leads to the goal state, but it requires several moves involving stacking and unstacking, especially to correct the sequence of B and C, and to place D in a position to support both A and B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, we need to start by placing block A on block D, as this aligns with one part of the goal configuration. After this, further actions can be taken to rearrange the other blocks as needed. The next action should aim to prepare for the subsequent stacking required to achieve the goal configuration.

In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B, we need to consider how to efficiently use the robot's actions starting from the current state. Currently, block B is in the robot's hand, and blocks C and D are on the table and clear. The goal configuration is complex but noticing that block B needs to end up on block C, the immediate action should involve block B since it's already held by the robot. Therefore, stacking block B on block C is a strategic move. Following this, the goal requires block D to be on block B which isn't possible directly after the first action, but setting up for future moves is essential.

Actions: stack(b:default,c:default), put-down(b:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is currently empty. There are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is on the table. Blocks A, B, and C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Block D is also on the table and clear, indicated by the predicates. This setup implies an initial configuration where no blocks are stacked on top of each other, and the robot is ready to manipulate any of the blocks as they are all clear and accessible.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state presents a simple starting configuration where all blocks are on the table and clear, providing maximum flexibility for any stacking action needed to achieve the goal. The goal is to have a specific configuration where A is on D, B is on C, and D is on B. However, the stated goal configuration seems contradictory or impossible as it requires D to be both under A and over B simultaneously. This suggests a logical inconsistency in the goal description, making it unachievable from any initial state.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, all four blocks (A, B, C, D) are located on the table. Each block (A, B, C, D) is clear, meaning no other block is on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup allows the robot to perform actions such as picking up any block since they are all accessible and the hand is ready to manipulate them.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows all blocks (A, B, C, D) are clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty. This is a typical starting configuration in Blocksworld, providing maximal flexibility for the robot to begin any sequence of moves. The goal is to arrange the blocks so that A is on D, B is on C, and D is on B. Since all blocks are initially clear and accessible, the robot can begin by picking up any block to start forming the required stack. The current setup allows direct progression towards the goal through a series of stacking actions, following the optimal or near-optimal sequence. This setup is conducive to achieving the goal with no pre-existing impediments or misplaced blocks.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocks World environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each block is positioned as follows:

- Block A is clear (nothing is on top of it) and is on the table.
- Block B is also clear and is positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C is on the table but not clear because Block B is on top of it.
- Block D is clear and is on the table.

Additionally, the robot hand is currently empty. The configuration suggests that the blocks are partially stacked with Block B over Block C, and Blocks A and D are separate on the table.
Goal State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, the goal is to reconfigure a set of blocks such that block A is on block D, block B is on block C, and block D is on block B. This will require careful manipulation using the available actions to stack and unstack the blocks as needed to achieve this specific arrangement.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state has block B already stacked on block C, which aligns with part of the goal state where block B needs to be on block C. However, the goal state also requires block A on block D, and block D on block B, which is not currently the case. The robot hand being empty is useful as it allows for immediate action such as picking up and stacking blocks as required. The proximity of blocks A and D being clear and on the table is advantageous because they can be easily manipulated to stack in the required order with few intermediate steps.

VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: In the current state, all blocks (A, B, C, D) are on the table and clear, and the robot hand is empty. This setup is the most flexible starting point for any rearrangement as no blocks are stacked, and each block is accessible for any action. The goal requires a specific stack order where A is on D, B is on C, and D is on B. Starting from this initial setup, it is possible to achieve the goal state by executing a series of stacking actions. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it can immediately begin operations without needing to put down a currently held block. Given that no incorrect stacking exists that would need to be undone, and all blocks are accessible, the current state is conducive to reaching the goal state through a sequence of correct actions.
