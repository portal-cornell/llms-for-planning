Actions:
- unstack(a:default,b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the following conditions are present:
- The robot hand is currently holding block A.
- Block C is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also clear and is stacked on top of block D.
- Block D is on the table.

This setup involves four blocks, labeled A, B, C, and D, with specific positions and statuses that define the current state of the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block A, which is a necessary step towards placing block A below block C as required in the goal state. Block B is already correctly placed on top of block D, matching the goal state's requirement for these two blocks. However, Block C and D need to be rearranged; block C should be moved on top of block A, and block D should be under block C, which is not currently the case. The positions of blocks C and D need to be rearranged to achieve the goal state, but the current configuration is conducive to making these changes since block C is clear and can be easily moved.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current Blocksworld scenario, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The configuration of these blocks is as follows: Block a is positioned on top of block b, and block b is on top of block d. Block d is directly on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block c. Additionally, block a is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it. This setup reflects the state of the blocks, their positions, and the status of the robot hand within the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block a is on b, and b is on d, with the robot hand holding block c. In the goal state, the desired configuration has block b on d, c on a, and d on c. The hand holding c is an advantage because the next move can directly contribute to achieving the goal state by stacking c somewhere. However, the entire configuration needs rearranging since the goal state is vastly different from the current setup, especially with block d needing to be positioned differently.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal, we need to accomplish a specific configuration of blocks. Notably, the robot hand is currently holding block A. The goal state requires block C on top of block A and block D on the table with block C on top of it. The first action should be to put down block A on the table since this will allow block C to be stacked on it later. Following this, stacking block C on block A aligns directly with the desired goal state configuration.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal requires stacking C on A and B on D, with D at the base. Currently, the robot hand is holding block A. To achieve the goal, I first need to place A on the table to free the hand, then unstack B from D so that D is free to have C stacked on it.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the goal state, I need to orchestrate the blocks in a manner that aligns with the desired configuration. Currently, the robot's hand holds block A, and the actions available are to stack A on B or C, or to put A down. To achieve the final configuration, A needs to be under C, so putting A down first would be logical, allowing subsequent actions to stack C on A. However, I need to propose two actions, and the immediate next action after putting A down would be to pick up C (since it is clear) to prepare for stacking it on A.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, where block C needs to be on top of block A and block D should be at the base of a stack with B and C, we should consider utilizing the robot hand currently holding block A. Given the valid actions, we can either stack A on another block or put it down. To align with the goal of having C on top of A, the best initial action is to put down A and then pick it up again to prepare it for stacking under C.

Think: The goal is to achieve a stack with block D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, and another stack where C is on A. Currently, the robot hand is holding block A, and block C is clear on the table. The valid actions allow for stacking A on B or C, or putting A down. To progress towards the goal, block A should be stacked on C, as specified in the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To make progress towards the goal state, I need to consider the positions of blocks and the robot hand. Since block A is currently held by the robot and needs to be under block C in the goal state, it can be placed on the table first, making it available to be a base for other blocks. After putting down block A, picking up block C and stacking it on block A would be a step towards the goal formation of C on A.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The robot hand currently holds block A, and the goal is to have block C on top of A and a stack formed with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top. The action 'put-down(a:default)' will allow block A to be placed on the table, making it possible to later stack C on A. The second action should be 'stack(a:default,c:default)' to move towards the goal configuration, but this action is not valid in the current state as A needs to be clear first. Therefore, the next best action is to put down block A, making it available for the next actions in subsequent moves.

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is empty. All of the blocks A, C, and D are on the table and are clear, meaning there's nothing on top of them. Block B is on top of block D and is also clear. This setup suggests that the blocks are arranged with B stacked on D, while A and C are separately on the table without any blocks on top.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks B and D already correctly stacked, which aligns with part of the goal state where B needs to be on D. However, blocks C and A are not in the desired position as per the goal state, where C should be on A and then D should be stacked on C to form the three-block tower. Since the robot hand is empty, it can perform the necessary actions to rearrange blocks C and A, and subsequently place D on top of C.

VALUE PROMPT 2

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four objects identified as blocks A, B, C, and D. The robot's hand is empty. Block C is on the table, and Block A is stacked on top of Block C. Block D is also on the table, and Block B is on top of Block D. Both Blocks A and B are clear, indicating that there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: Analyzing the current state and the goal state reveals a mismatch in the arrangement of the blocks. Currently, block A is stacked on block C, and block B is on top of block D, which partially aligns with the goal for block B and D. However, the goal also requires block C to be on top of block A, and block D to be the base of a three-block stack with B on top and C in the middle. The current state, with C and A reversed and no three-block stack, shows that significant rearrangements are needed. The robot's empty hand can facilitate these rearrangements.

VALUE PROMPT 3

Current State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The current configuration of these blocks and the robot hand is as follows:

1. Block a is on top of block b.
2. Block b is on top of block d.
3. Block c is on top of block a, forming a stack.
4. Block d is directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is empty.
6. Blocks c and d are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.

This setup reflects a complex stacking arrangement among the blocks, with the robot's hand available for manipulating the blocks to achieve any desired configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state presents a partially correct setup towards the goal state. Currently, block b is correctly placed on top of block d which aligns with the goal state configuration. However, the arrangement of blocks c and a needs adjusting. Block c is currently on top of block a, mirroring part of the goal state, but the goal also requires block d to be at the base of a three-block stack topped with blocks c and b. The robot's hand being empty is advantageous, as it allows for immediate action to rearrange the blocks. The next steps would involve manipulating blocks c and a to form the correct tower with d, and ensuring b is on top of d, as required.

VALUE PROMPT 4

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. These blocks can interact with each other and the table in several ways, as specified by the current predicates. Here's the summary:

1. Block a is on top of block b, and block a is also clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
2. Block b is on top of block d.
3. Block c is on the table and is clear, which means it is not under any other block and no other blocks are on top of it.
4. Block d is also directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the initial configuration of blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state indicates a configuration where block a is on b, b on d, and c is clear on the table. The goal is to have b on d, c on a, and d on c. Given this, the current placement of b on d aligns with the goal state, simplifying the steps needed for that part. However, the major rearrangement required involves moving blocks a, c, and d to achieve the goal configuration of c on a and d on c. Although the robot's hand is empty, which is beneficial for performing the next moves, significant reordering is still needed, suggesting a moderate complexity in transitioning from the current to the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, where block C is supposed to be on top of block A and block D at the base of a stack that includes C and B, the first action should involve manipulating block C since it's currently free and needs to be positioned over block A. Given that the robot hand is empty, the logical step is to pick up block C. The second action should be to place block C on top of block A, aligning with part of the goal state. However, since the action "stack(c:default,a:default)" is not explicitly listed as valid, it may be necessary to clarify the availability of stacking actions after picking up a block.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to form two specific stacks: one with B on D and another with C on A. Since B is already on D, the action to unstack B from D is unnecessary unless it's part of a larger strategy to rearrange other blocks. The valid actions allow us to manipulate blocks A and C directly. To work towards the goal, picking up block C seems beneficial as it prepares us to stack it later. Additionally, picking up block A will enable us to prepare for stacking C on A.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block B is already correctly placed on top of Block D, aligning with part of the goal state. Block C is being held by the robot hand, which is a necessary condition before it can be placed on another block or on the table. However, the goal state description seems internally inconsistent as it describes Block D being both directly under Block B and under Block C at the same time, which is impossible in a standard Blocksworld setup. Assuming a possible error in the goal state description, and considering a logical correction (Block C on A, B on D), Block C needs to be placed on Block A, which is achievable since A is clear. The robot hand holding Block C is a good intermediary state for achieving this part of the goal.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: Evaluating the current state against the goal state, the robot hand is holding block A which is a necessary step before placing it down or stacking it under another block. For the goal state, block A needs to be under block C. Since block C is clear and on the table, the next logical step could be putting down block A and then stacking block C on top of it. Block B is already on top of block D, which aligns with the goal state configuration. The main discrepancy is the positioning of blocks C and D relative to A and each other. The current setup is constructive towards achieving the goal state as it requires minimal rearrangement to align with the goal configuration.

VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state and the goal state involve the same blocks but arranged differently. Currently, block B is in the robot hand, and blocks A and C are on top of each other with A on C. The goal is for B to be on D, C on A, and D on the table. Currently, D is clear and on the table, which aligns with part of the goal state. The robot can put down B on D directly, which is a step towards the goal. However, C needs to be rearranged from its current position (under A) to be on top of A, which will require additional steps like moving A first. The goal state's complexity and the need for multiple correct actions suggest that while the current state has some elements in the right position (D on the table), significant rearrangement is needed.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block C to be stacked on block A, and block D to be below block C with block B on top; however, B is already on D, so arranging C and A is essential. Currently, the robot is holding block C, and it can be stacked directly on block A according to the valid actions available. After placing C on A, the configuration of D and B remains unchanged, which aligns with part of the goal state.

Actions: stack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default)

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Here's the configuration:

- Block A is positioned on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is also on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block D.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at the moment. Both Block C and Block B are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block C is already correctly placed on top of Block A, and Block B is on top of Block D as required by the goal. However, the goal state requires Block D to be moved under Block C, forming a stack of D-C-B. Since Block D is currently on the table with Block B on top, the robot would need to first remove Block B from Block D, then move Block D under Block C, and finally restack Block B on top of the new stack D-C. The current state is close to the goal state but requires several moves to rearrange the blocks correctly.

VALUE PROMPT 2

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is empty. All of the blocks A, C, and D are on the table and are clear, meaning there's nothing on top of them. Block B is on top of block D and is also clear. This setup suggests that the blocks are arranged with B stacked on D, while A and C are separately on the table without any blocks on top.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block B is already on top of block D, which is a partial fulfillment of the goal state. However, the goal also requires block C to be on top of block A, with block D being at the base of a three-block stack (D-C-B). In the current state, C and A are separate on the table, and D is already occupied with B on top. To move towards the goal, actions would need to be planned to stack C on A and then rearrange the blocks such that D supports both C and B as described in the goal. Since B is already on D, and no other blocks obstruct the movement of C and A, the current state is conducive to achieving the goal with a series of correct moves.

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. These blocks can interact with each other and the table in several ways, as specified by the current predicates. Here's the summary:

1. Block a is on top of block b, and block a is also clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
2. Block b is on top of block d.
3. Block c is on the table and is clear, which means it is not under any other block and no other blocks are on top of it.
4. Block d is also directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the initial configuration of blocks and the status of the robot's hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state has block a on top of block b, and block b on top of block d, while block c is clear on the table, and the robot hand is empty. To reach the goal state where block b is on top of block d, block c on top of block a, and block d on top of block c, several actions need to be taken. The current position of block b on top of block d aligns with the goal state, but block a needs to be moved for block c to be on top of it, and block d needs to be cleared to place block c on it. The arrangement of block b and d is already correct, providing a good starting point towards the goal.

In the current environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. The block 'a' is positioned on the table with block 'c' placed on top of it. Both blocks 'd' and 'c' are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Block 'b' is currently being held by the robot hand. Additionally, block 'd' is also on the table.

The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current configuration has blocks a, b, c, and d in positions that partially align with the goal state requirements. Block c is already correctly placed on top of block a, which matches one part of the goal state. However, the goal state requires a stack with d at the base, c in the middle, and b on top, which is different from the current setup where block d is on the table and unstacked, and block b is held by the robot hand. To achieve the goal, the following actions are necessary: the robot must put down block b, pick up block c (after removing it from atop block a), stack it on block d, and then stack block b on block c. Given that block c is already correctly placed on block a, the robot can work on creating the stack of d, c, and b while maintaining the position of c on a after repositioning.

- Block B is stacked on top of Block D, and Block B is also clear.
- Block C is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block D is on the table.

This setup involves the blocks being in specific positions relative to each other and the table, with the robot hand actively holding one of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state and the goal state show specific configurations that need to be achieved with the blocks and the robot hand. In the current state:
- Block A is clear and on the table, which is a good starting point for placing another block on it.
- Block B is already stacked on Block D, which aligns with the goal state's requirement for B to be on top of D.
- Block C is being held by the robot hand, which means it can be directly placed on top of Block A, aligning with the goal state's configuration of C on A.
- Block D is on the table, and for the goal state, it needs to be at the base of a stack with B on top, which is currently the case.

Since C needs to be placed directly on A and B is already correctly positioned on D, the robot hand's next logical action would be to place C on A. The major discrepancy is the goal state's incorrect description which seems to suggest D should be on top of C, which is not feasible since B is already on D. Assuming a typo in the goal state description, the current state is indeed on the path to achieving the correct configuration of the blocks if C is placed on A.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Currently, blocks a, c, and d are all placed on the table. Block b is being held by the robot hand. Blocks a, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them, and they are available for manipulation.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state has block b in the robot hand and blocks a, c, and d on the table, all clear. To reach the goal where block B is on D, C on A, and D on C, the first logical step would be to stack block D on C, as both are clear and on the table. Block b, currently held, could be put down on D once that stack is made, or it could be put down temporarily to manipulate D or C if necessary. The robot hand being occupied with b does not hinder the possibility of progressing towards the goal state, though it requires an additional step (putting down b) before other blocks can be picked up or stacked. The arrangement of blocks in the current state allows for straightforward actions towards the goal configuration.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block B is on top of block D, and D is at the base of a stack with C and B, we need to first free block D to be the base. Since block B is already being held by the robot hand, placing B directly on D is a strategic move. However, the goal also requires block C to be on top of block A, which is already the case. So, the immediate step should be to stack B on D, then reassess the subsequent step for realigning blocks if necessary.

Actions: stack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

1. Block A is placed directly on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
3. Block C is placed directly on top of Block B, and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
4. Block D is directly on the table.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup involves a vertical stack where Block C is on Block B, which is on Block D, while Blocks A and D are resting on the table, with Blocks A and C being clear for potential manipulation. The robot hand is available to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: From the current configuration, achieving the goal state requires a series of operations. Currently, Block B is already on Block D, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, Block C needs to be moved from its current position on top of Block B to on top of Block A. Additionally, Block D needs to be placed on top of Block C to form the three-block stack as described in the goal. Since the robot's hand is empty, it can pick up Block C directly. The process will involve unstacking Block C from Block B, placing Block C on Block A, then lifting Block D and stacking it on top of Block C. The current state has some elements that are already in place, such as Block B being on Block D, and other elements that are not aligned with the goal but can be adjusted with available actions.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state is closely aligned with the goal state in terms of the position of some blocks, but there is a contradiction in the arrangement described in the goal state. The goal state describes block D as being at the base of a stack with C and B above it, but it also wants C on top of A in a separate stack, which is not possible in a 4-block setup. This likely indicates a misunderstanding in the description of the goal. If we correct the goal to a feasible configuration based on the 4 blocks, the current state shows that B is already correctly placed on D, and C is correctly placed on A. This alignment suggests that minimal actions are needed if the goal is adjusted to a feasible setup, like stacking D on C while B remains on D and C remains on A.

Rating: maybe

This rating follows the assumption that there is either an error in the goal state description or that with minor adjustments to the goal, the current state would be well-aligned. As it stands, the goal state as described is impossible to achieve with the given blocks and configuration, which would otherwise make the rating "impossible."

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a table. The current configuration is as follows:

- Block D is clear and on the table.
- Block B is clear and on the table.
- Block A is also on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A and is clear.

The robot hand is currently empty. This setup forms the basis for performing actions such as picking up a block, stacking one block on another, or moving blocks back onto the table to reach a new configuration.
Goal State:
The goal in this scenario is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration where block B is on top of block D, block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C. This setup forms a stack of three blocks with D at the base, C in the middle, and B on top, along with a separate stack where C is directly on block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that blocks D, B, and A are on the table, and block C is already on top of block A, which is part of the final desired configuration. However, the goal state requires block D to be at the base of a three-block stack with B on top of C, which is on top of D. Currently, D and B are both on the table, not in a stacked position, and C is on A, not on D. To achieve the goal, the robot must first move block C from A to D, which is achievable given the current configuration since C is clear. After this, block B, which is also clear, can be placed on top of C, forming the desired stack of D-C-B. Thus, while the current configuration does not immediately meet the goal, it contains elements that are correctly positioned (C on A), and the remaining blocks are in positions that allow for feasible moves to reach the goal state.

To reach the goal state, the robot must put down C and subsequently stack it on A, which is not currently under any blocks and is clear. However, the goal also describes an impossible situation where D is supposed to be on C while C is on A, which is a contradictory requirement as a block cannot be simultaneously above and below another specific block.

Think: 
In the current state, block A is held by the robot hand, while the stack of blocks is B on D, with C on top of B. Considering the goal state, block B must remain on D, which aligns with the current configuration. However, the goal requires block C to be on block A and block D on top of block C, which significantly differs from the current setup. The robot must first put down block A, then rearrange blocks C and D in a specific order to achieve the goal. Given that the current alignment of B on D aligns with the goal, but the rest does not, there is still a fair amount of rearrangement required.

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block A, which is a necessary step before block A can be placed on the table or under another block as per the goal state. The current stacking of B on D is aligned with part of the goal configuration, but block C needs to be rearranged from its current position on top of B to on top of block A. Additionally, block D needs to be rearranged to be on top of block C for the goal configuration. This indicates that several moves are required: block A needs to be placed down, block C needs to be unstacked from B, and subsequently, D and C need to be re-stacked appropriately. The current state allows these moves to be possible, suggesting that it is on the path toward the desired goal state, but not close to completion yet.
