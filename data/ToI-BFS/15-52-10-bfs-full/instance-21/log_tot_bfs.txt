ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with actions that involve moving these blocks. Currently, block D is clear with nothing on top of it. Block C is on the table. Block B is being held by the robot hand. Block D is directly on top of block A, and block A is on top of block C. This setup involves a stack where block C at the base supports block A, which in turn supports block D, while block B is held and ready to be placed or stacked.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This setup will require careful manipulation of the blocks using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block D is on top of block A, which is on top of block C, and block B is in the robot's hand. To reach the goal state where block A is on block C, block B on block D, and block D on block A, significant rearrangement is needed. Since block D is already on block A, part of the goal condition is met. However, to arrange block B on block D, the robot would need to put down B temporarily, unstack D from A, stack D on B, and then stack B on D as per the goal. This sequence involves multiple steps that are logically consistent with the actions available in the environment.

Rating: maybe

This rating is given because the current state is partially aligned with the goal state, but requires several correct actions to transition fully to the goal state. The feasibility of reaching the goal from the current state depends on executing these actions in the correct sequence, making it a plausible but not certain path to the goal.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the following conditions are observed:
- Block 'a' is placed on block 'c'.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'd'.
- Block 'c' is positioned on the table.
- Both blocks 'b' and 'a' are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
- Block 'b' is also positioned on the table.

The objects involved in this scenario are blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This setup will require careful manipulation of the blocks using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The goal state is contradictory and impossible to achieve because it describes a circular arrangement where block D is on block A, and simultaneously, block A is on block C. This configuration defies the physical constraints of the Blocksworld, as a block cannot be both supporting another block and be supported by it in a circular manner. The current state shows block A on block C and block B and D clear, which doesn't align with any physically possible configuration that would match the goal state described.

Rating: impossible

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 PROMPT
--------------------

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current environment, the following conditions are observed:
- Block 'a' is placed on block 'c'.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'd'.
- Block 'c' is positioned on the table.
- Both blocks 'b' and 'a' are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them.
- Block 'b' is also positioned on the table.

The objects involved in this scenario are blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,a:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This setup will require careful manipulation of the blocks using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, where block B is on block D, and block D is on block A, the current step should involve placing block D strategically. Since the robot hand is currently holding block D, we can use the action to stack it on block A, which aligns with the goal configuration of block D being on block A. Following this action, the next priority will be to ensure other blocks are positioned to allow block B to be eventually placed on block D. However, since this step requires only two actions and stacking D on A is crucial, the second action should be to put down block D if it was not stacked properly in the first action. This ensures that block D is either ideally placed or ready for repositioning in subsequent steps.

Actions: stack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, as well as a table and a robot hand. The arrangement and status of these blocks and the robot hand are as follows: 

- Block A is positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C is directly on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block D.
- Block D is positioned directly on Block A.
- Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This setup will require careful manipulation of the blocks using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The description of the current state already matches the goal state description perfectly. Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on top of Block D, and Block D is on top of Block A, as specified in the goal. Since the robot's hand is empty, no further actions are required to rearrange the blocks, indicating that the current state is already the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block A.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- Blocks B and D are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on top of them.
- The robot hand is not holding any blocks and is empty.

This setup forms part of a Blocksworld scenario where the goal involves rearranging these blocks into a new configuration using a sequence of actions executed by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This setup will require careful manipulation of the blocks using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has block A on top of block C and block D stacked on top of block A, with blocks B and C on the table. The goal state requires block A on block C, block B on block D, and block D on block A, which is contradictory and impossible given the nature of physical objects. Blocks can't be both supporting and supported by the same blocks simultaneously (e.g., D cannot be both under A and under B at the same time if B is also on A). Therefore, the goal state as described is physically impossible to achieve from the current or any state.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is placed on top of Block C.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block A.
- Blocks B and C are directly on the table.
- Blocks B and D are clear, meaning no other blocks are stacked on top of them.
- The robot hand is not holding any blocks and is empty.

This setup forms part of a Blocksworld scenario where the goal involves rearranging these blocks into a new configuration using a sequence of actions executed by the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This setup will require careful manipulation of the blocks using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires Block A on Block C, Block B on Block D, and Block D on Block A. However, the configuration where Block D is on Block A while Block A is on Block C is not feasible since a block cannot be both supporting and supported by the same block. This inherent contradiction in the goal state makes it impossible to achieve from any current state.

Rating: impossible

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the blocks are arranged as follows:

- Block A is placed on top of Block C and is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block B is clear and is positioned on the table.
- Block C is also on the table but has Block A on top of it.
- Block D is clear and situated on the table as well.

Additionally, the robot hand is empty at this moment, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange blocks in a specific configuration where block A is on block C, block B is on block D, and block D is on block A. This setup will require careful manipulation of the blocks using the available actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking to achieve the desired configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The description of the goal state suggests an impossible configuration because it states that block D should be both directly under block B and on top of block A simultaneously, creating a cyclic dependency that cannot exist in a physically realizable arrangement of objects. Given this description, the current state cannot be on the path to the described goal state since the goal state itself is unachievable.
