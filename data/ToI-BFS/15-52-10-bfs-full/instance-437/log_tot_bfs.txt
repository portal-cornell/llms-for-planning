VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is holding block A. Blocks B and C are placed directly on the table. Block D is on top of Block C and is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it. Additionally, Block B is also clear. This setup indicates that Blocks B and D are free to be moved or have other blocks stacked on them, while Block C is not clear due to having Block D on top.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has the robot hand holding Block A, while Block B and C are on the table and Block D is stacked on Block C. To reach the goal state where Block A is on Block B, which is on Block C, which is on Block D, several actions are needed:
1. Put down Block A on the table or stack it temporarily on Block B.
2. Unstack Block D from Block C.
3. Stack Block C on Block D.
4. Stack Block B on Block C.
5. Finally, stack Block A on Block B.

Since the robot hand is already holding Block A, it can efficiently initiate these steps. The sequence of actions from the current state to the goal state involves straightforward stacking and unstacking, suggesting that the current state is conducive to progressing toward the goal.

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block D is being held by the robot's hand. Block A is placed on top of block B, and both blocks A and C are clear, with nothing on top of them. Blocks B and C are positioned on the table. This setup involves interactions between the blocks and the robot's hand, affecting their placement and status of being clear or held.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block D is in the robot's hand, which is crucial as it needs to be placed down first to be the base of the tower in the goal state. The block sequence A on B is already correct and aligns with the part of the goal state. Block C is clear and on the table, ready to be stacked upon. The first step towards achieving the goal would be to put down block D on the table, then stack block C on D, and finally stack block B (with A already on it) on C. The configuration is thus conducive to achieving the goal state with a series of logical moves.

Think: To reach the goal state, we need to achieve a tower with the order D, C, B, A from bottom to top. Currently, the robot hand is holding block A, and blocks B, C, and D are not in the desired arrangement. As block B is clear and we need A to be on top of B eventually, the direct action here would be to place A on B. After this, we would want to rearrange C and D, but since our limit is two actions, we'll focus on setting up A on B first.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal of stacking all blocks in a vertical tower from D at the base to A at the top, the first logical step is to place Block D on the table, as it is currently held by the robot's hand. This action will allow the subsequent stacking of other blocks upon Block D. The next action would ideally involve stacking another block on D; however, since the desired order puts Block C directly on D, and since C is clear and on the table, the next action should be to stack Block C on Block D.

Think: In the current state, the robot's hand is holding block D. To progress towards the goal state where D is at the base of the stack, the first logical step is to place D on the table. Then, since Block C is already on the table and clear, the robot can stack D on C, which aligns with the goal state configuration of having C on top of D.

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d are positioned as follows:
- Block a is placed on top of block b, and block a is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it.
- Block b is directly on the table.
- Block c is also on the table, and block d is positioned on top of block c.
- Block d is clear, indicating that there is no block on top of it.
- Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state describes two mini-stacks: one with block a on block b, and another with block d on block c. The goal state requires a single stack where blocks a, b, c, and d are arranged vertically from top to bottom in the order a, b, c, d. To reach the goal state from the current state, several actions are needed:
1. Unstack block a from block b.
2. Unstack block d from block c.
3. Stack block b on block c.
4. Stack block a on the new stack of b and c.
5. Finally, stack this entire group on block d. 
Given that the robot hand is empty, which is necessary to perform the first unstacking action, the current state is conducive to initiating these actions. Therefore, the current state seems to be on a plausible path towards achieving the goal state, provided the correct sequence of moves is followed.

Current State:
In the environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration and status:

- Block A is clear and on the table.
- Block B is clear and on the table.
- Block C is also on the table.
- Block D is on top of Block C and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks A and B are directly on the table without any other blocks on top of them, allowing them to be picked up or used as a base to stack other blocks. Block D is positioned above Block C, with no other blocks on it, making D movable. The robot hand being empty suggests it's ready to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block A and Block B are clear and on the table, while Block D is stacked on Block C. The goal is to have a tower with Block D at the base, followed by Block C, Block B, and Block A at the top. To achieve this, Block D must remain at the base, which aligns with its current position. However, Block C needs to be moved from being under Block D to being on top of it. Blocks A and B need to be arranged on top of the stack in the proper order. The empty robot hand allows for the flexibility to perform necessary operations like unstacking and stacking to configure the blocks as required by the goal state.

Rating: maybe

The current arrangement of blocks suggests that the necessary steps to reach the goal involve rearranging most of the blocks, but the empty robot hand and the clarity of certain blocks (A, B, D) provide a reasonable starting point to achieve the desired configuration. However, the process will require several intermediate steps, and the correct sequence of actions is crucial. Hence, the path to the goal state seems feasible but not guaranteed without knowing more about the sequence of actions that will be taken.

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Block b and block c are both on the table. Block a is on top of block b, and block d is also placed on the table. Blocks a, c, and d are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking any of the clear blocks.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that blocks b and c are on the table with block a on top of block b, and block d also on the table, with blocks a, c, and d clear. The goal state requires blocks to be arranged in a specific vertical order from top to bottom: a, b, c, d. Given that block a is already on top of block b, part of the goal state is already achieved. However, block b needs to be stacked on block c, which is currently on the table and not underneath block b. Additionally, block c must be on top of block d, which is also on the table. The robot’s hand being empty is beneficial as it can immediately perform actions such as picking up block c and stacking it on block d, followed by moving block b (with a still on top) onto block c. Since the current arrangement partially matches the goal and the remaining actions to achieve the full goal are straightforward with the robot's capabilities, it is likely that the current state is on the path to achieving the goal state.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state shows a configuration where block a is on b, and b is on the table. Similarly, block d is on c, which is on the table. The goal state requires a vertical sequence with d at the base, followed by c, b, and a at the top. To reach the goal state, actions need to be taken to rearrange blocks c and d, and then stack b and a accordingly on top of them. Since the robot hand is empty, it is capable of performing actions like picking up and stacking blocks as needed. The configuration is not too far off from the goal, but significant rearranging is needed.

Think: To progress towards the goal configuration where Block A is on top of Block B, which is on top of Block C, and then Block C on top of Block D, we need to start by making Block D accessible to stack other blocks on it. Currently, Block D is on top of Block C. The robot hand is empty, which is suitable for moving Block D first. The most logical first action is to unstack Block D from Block C, making Block C accessible. After unstacking Block D, the next step would be to pick up Block D with the robot hand, so it can be later placed on the table or prepared for future stacking.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, the first action should involve making Block D accessible as a base since in the goal state it is at the bottom of the stack. Currently, Block D is stacked on top of Block C, so the logical step is to unstack D from C. After unstacking D, the next action should be picking up Block B as it will eventually need to be stacked on top of Block C, according to the goal state.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks a, b, and c on the table, all clear, and block d in the robot hand. The goal state requires a tower with d at the base, then c, b, and a on top, in that order. The robot hand is currently holding d, which is optimal since the next action towards the goal state involves placing d either directly on the table or stacking it on another block. Since d needs to be at the bottom of the stack in the goal state, the robot should put down d on the table. From there, c, b, and a can be sequentially stacked on d. This sequence of actions is directly supported by the current configuration and capabilities of the robot hand.

2. Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
3. Block C is on the table.
4. Block D is stacked on top of Block C, and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of D.

This setup describes the initial configuration and status of each block and the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where Block A is on top of Block B, Block B on top of Block C, and Block C on top of Block D, the following steps need to be considered from the current state:
1. Since Block B is already held by the robot hand, the next action can be to place Block B on top of Block C.
2. Subsequently, Block C, which is supporting Block D, needs to be repositioned such that it can be placed on Block D. This requires unstacking Block D from Block C and then stacking Block C on Block D.
3. Finally, Block A can be picked up from the table and stacked on top of Block B.

Given these steps, the current state is quite favorable for progressing towards the goal state because the robot hand is already holding Block B, which aligns well with the next required actions. The main challenge is the repositioning of Block D and Block C, but this is a standard action sequence in the Blocksworld.

- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Since the goal is to stack Block A on top of Block B, and Block B on top of Block C, and Block C on top of Block D, the current action should involve placing Block D at a position where it can be the base of this tower. Block D is currently held by the robot hand. The first action should be to place Block D on the table to prepare it for stacking other blocks on top. After placing Block D down, the next step is to unstack or pick up Block C, but since the valid actions do not include any direct manipulation of Block C, I will choose the valid action that progresses towards the goal, which is stacking another block on D.

Think: To progress towards the goal state, the first action to consider is placing block d at the base as specified in the goal state. From the valid actions, I can put block d down on the table. Once block d is on the table, the hand will be free, allowing subsequent actions to stack other blocks. My second action should ideally be to start building the tower from block d, but since block c is clear and the goal is to have block c on block d, the correct second action would be to stack block c on block d.

Think: Given the goal to stack all blocks in a single vertical tower with D at the base and A at the top, the first logical action is to place D on the table, which is already the case. Since the robot hand is currently holding block D, the next step is to put down block D on the table to free the hand.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE

Think: To move towards the goal state where Block A is on top of Block B, which is on top of Block C, and Block C is on top of Block D, the robot hand should first place Block D on the table to make it the base of the tower. Then, it can pick up and stack Block C on Block D. This aligns with the goal of having Block D at the base. Currently, the robot hand is holding Block D, and all other blocks are clear on the table.

Think: To achieve the goal state where A is on B, B is on C, and C is on D, I need to start by placing D on the table, since it is currently held by the robot hand and needs to be the base of our desired stack. After placing D down, I should proceed by stacking C on D, as this sets up the foundation of the tower.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To approach the goal state, it's necessary to create a vertical stack with block D at the base. With block D currently held by the robot hand, the first strategic move is to place D on the table (if not already there). Subsequently, stacking C on D is essential since C should be immediately above D according to the goal configuration. Given the current state and valid actions, the first action is to put D on the table. The next logical action, adhering to the goal configuration, is to stack C on D. However, since 'stack(c:default,d:default)' is not currently available and was deemed invalid in a previous attempt, the simulator might require D to be clearly mentioned as on the table in the current state description for this action to become valid. Therefore, the proposal will focus on completing the first part of the formation by putting down D, and then re-evaluate the available actions.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To approach the goal state, the blocks need to be arranged in a specific sequence: A on B, B on C, and C on D. Currently, B is being held by the robot hand, and the only valid action to place B is related to Blocks D or A. Placing B on either D or A does not directly contribute to the goal sequence. However, since putting B down is a valid action and necessary for rearranging, I will select that as the first step. After putting B down, the robot hand will be free, potentially allowing new actions in the next state.

Actions: put-down(b:default), stack(b:default,a:default)

Current State:
In the current state of the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned on the table and there is nothing on top of them, indicating that all blocks are clear. The robot hand is empty at the moment.

Think: The current state shows that all blocks (A, B, C, D) are clear and on the table, with the robot hand empty. This state provides a clean slate to start building the tower as described in the goal state. Since all blocks are clear and accessible, the robot can start the stacking process by first picking up Block D, placing Block C on it, then Block B on C, and finally Block A on B. The current state allows for the flexibility to perform these actions in an efficient sequence without needing to rearrange or unstack any blocks first.

- Block C is also on the table.
- Block D is on top of Block C and is clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks A and B are directly on the table without any other blocks on top of them, allowing them to be picked up or used as a base to stack other blocks. Block D is positioned above Block C, with no other blocks on it, making D movable. The robot hand being empty suggests it's ready to perform actions like picking up or stacking blocks.

Think: In the current state, all blocks are on the table except for Block D, which is on top of Block C. This setup does not align directly with the goal state configuration, which requires a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A on top, followed by B and C. However, the current state provides a starting point where the robot can reorganize the blocks since Block D is already placed on Block C, and both A and B are clear and available for manipulation. The robot hand being empty is also advantageous as it allows immediate action without needing to put down a block first.

VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, blocks A and B are both clear and on the table, which facilitates their manipulation. Block C, however, is not clear, with Block D stacked on top of it. The goal requires Block C to be at the base of a stack under B, D, and A, in that order. The robot hand being empty is suitable for starting operations like picking up or unstacking. The necessary actions to move towards the goal state from the current state would involve unstacking D from C, moving D to either the table or directly onto another block as required by future steps, and then rearranging A, B, and C as specified in the goal.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks a and b in one stack and blocks c and d in another stack, whereas the goal state requires a single stack where D is at the base, followed by C, B, and A on top. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it is ready to perform operations like picking up or unstacking without needing to put down a block first. To move towards the goal state:
1. Unstack block b from block a.
2. Unstack block d from block c.
3. Stack block c on block d.
4. Stack block b on block c.
5. Pick up and stack block a on block b.

Each step is feasible and follows logically from the configuration in the current state to reach the goal state configuration. Thus, the current state is effectively set up to progress towards the desired end state by following these clear steps.

Block D is already on top of Block C, which is not aligned with the goal state since Block B should be between them. This means the robot will need to unstack Block D from Block C, then stack Block B onto Block C, and finally restack Block D either on the table temporarily or directly on top of Block B. Block A is clear and on the table, so it can be picked up and placed on top of Block B once Block B is correctly stacked.

Then, block A needs to be free to be placed on top of B after B is stacked on C. The sequence of moves from the current state to the goal is logical and feasible with the given actions.

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks named a, b, c, and d. Block b is on the table, while block d is stacked on top of block b. Both blocks a and c are also on the table. Blocks a, c, and d are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks b, a, and c on the table, and block d is stacked on top of block b. To reach the goal state, where block A is on B, B is on C, and C is on D, a series of actions are needed. First, block d needs to be unstacked from block b and placed on the table or held by the robot hand. Then, block c must be placed on block d, followed by block b on block c, and finally block a on block b. The fact that d is already stacked on b in the current state creates one extra step (unstacking d from b) that is not directly productive towards the goal state but necessary to rearrange the blocks correctly. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it allows immediate action without needing to put down another block first. Although the current state involves some extra steps, it still contains all elements (blocks and an empty robot hand) that can feasibly lead to the goal state through a sequence of correct actions.

Current State:
In the given environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and these blocks are interacting with a table and a robot hand. Currently, the robot hand is empty. The block placement is as follows:

- Block B is clear (nothing is on top of it) and it is on the table.
- Block A is also clear and on the table.
- Block C is clear and is placed on top of block D.
- Block D is on the table.

This setup represents the initial state of the blocks in relation to each other and the table, with the robot hand ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking the blocks.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 3

Think: To evaluate if the current state is on the path to the goal state, it's crucial to analyze the block positions and what moves would be necessary to reach the goal configuration. In the current state, the robot hand is empty, which is essential for picking up any block. The goal is to have a tower of D-C-B-A. Currently, C is on D, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, A and B are both on the table and not in the correct sequence. The robot hand could pick up C, place it temporarily elsewhere (or hold it), then stack B on D, followed by C on B, and finally A on C. The sequence and actions to achieve the goal are clear, and the current state does not contain any contradictory or already misplaced blocks that would prevent reaching the goal.

Current State:
In the current state of the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each of these blocks is positioned on the table and there is nothing on top of them, indicating that all blocks are clear. The robot hand is empty at the moment. This setup allows for any block to be picked up by the robot hand, as all blocks are accessible and unobstructed.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state shows all blocks (A, B, C, D) on the table and clear, with the robot hand empty. This setup is a common starting point in Blocksworld problems and allows for any block to be directly manipulated. The goal state requires a specific arrangement where the blocks are stacked in a sequence from D at the base to A at the top. Given the initial state, each action needed to achieve the goal (picking up and stacking blocks in sequence) can be directly executed without the need to rearrange or move any blocks out of the way first. This direct path from the current state to the goal state indicates a high likelihood that the current state is on the path to achieving the goal.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To move towards the goal state where Block A is on top of Block B, which is on top of Block C, stacked on Block D, we must first handle the positioning of Block C and Block D since they are already in contact. The robot hand is empty, so we can utilize this to rearrange the blocks. The first action should involve unstacking Block C from Block D to free up Block D for subsequent stacking. After unstacking Block C, the next logical step would be to pick up Block B as it is clear and on the table, preparing it to be stacked on top of Block C in future actions.

In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Here’s the summary of the state of each object:

- Blocks a, b, and d are on the table.
- Block c is being held by the robot hand.
- Blocks a, b, and d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

This setup indicates that the robot hand is currently occupied, and it can interact with any of the clear blocks a, b, or d next, depending on the desired action, such as putting down block c or stacking it on another block.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

This stacking sequence will result in a vertical tower with Block D at the base and Block A at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block c, which is a positive step towards the goal state since block c needs to be placed on top of block d according to the goal. However, the rest of the blocks are still on the table and not in the configuration needed to achieve the goal. The robot needs to place block c on block d, then pick up block b to stack it on c, and finally stack block a on b. Considering these steps are necessary and the robot is currently holding block c, the current state is moving in the right direction, but there are still several actions required to reach the goal.

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration of these blocks and their statuses:

1. Block a is positioned on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block b is currently being held by the robot hand.
3. Block c is clear and is placed on top of block d.
4. Block d is located on the table, supporting block c above it.

This setup involves blocks being in various states such as on the table, being held, or stacked on top of another block. The robot hand is occupied as it is holding block b.
Goal State:
In the Blocksworld environment, the goal is to arrange the blocks in a specific configuration. The desired configuration for the blocks is as follows:

- Block A should be placed on top of Block B.
- Block B should be positioned on top of Block C.
- Block C should be stacked on top of Block D.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block b is in the robot hand, block c is on block d, and block a is clear on the table. The goal state requires block a to be on block b, block b on block c, and block c on block d. The current configuration of blocks c and d aligns with the goal state where block c is already on block d. However, block b needs to be put down on block c and then block a needs to be stacked on block b. Having block b in the hand is advantageous as the next steps can directly involve positioning it as per the goal requirements. The current state, therefore, supports progression towards the goal state but requires a sequence of correct moves.

Think: The current state has the robot holding Block A, which is a crucial step towards achieving the goal state where Block A needs to be on top of Block B. Since Blocks B, C, and D are clear and on the table, the robot can proceed to stack them accordingly. The next actions would ideally involve placing Block A on Block B, then stacking Block B on Block C, and finally placing Block C on Block D.

Think: The current state has block B in the robot hand and blocks A, C, and D clear on the table. To achieve the goal state, the following sequence is logical: place B on C, then place A on B, and finally ensure D is at the correct position to support C. The robot hand already holding B facilitates faster action towards stacking it on C, which is the next step in the sequence needed to achieve the goal configuration. Since the blocks are clear and the one needed next (B) is already picked up, the goal seems feasible from this state.

However, the configuration requires that block B be placed on block C, and block C on block D. Currently, blocks C and D are on the table separately and not stacked. The robot's hand is empty, which is beneficial as it allows for immediate action to rearrange the blocks. The immediate necessary actions involve moving block A temporarily, stacking B on C, then C on D, and replacing A on top of the stack. While the arrangement needs several moves, the current setup does not contradict the goal and provides a clear pathway to achieve it.
