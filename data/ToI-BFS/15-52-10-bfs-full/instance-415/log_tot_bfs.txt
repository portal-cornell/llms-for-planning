ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, which is a version of the classic Blocksworld with blocks, a table, and a robot hand, several conditions are currently met:

1. The robot hand is holding block 'd'.
2. Block 'a' is positioned on top of block 'b'.
3. Block 'c' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block 'b' is directly on the table.
5. Block 'c' is also on top of block 'a'.

The objects involved in this scenario are four blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. This setup describes the initial state of the blocks and the status of the robot's hand in relation to these blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has the robot hand holding block 'd', block 'a' on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is clear and on top of block 'a'. Comparing this to the goal state where block 'c' should be on top of block 'a' (which is already achieved) and block 'd' should be on top of block 'b', it appears that the next steps would involve the robot putting down block 'd' onto block 'b'. Since block 'b' is directly on the table and already has block 'a' under it, it is clear and ready to receive block 'd'. This would directly lead to the goal state. Thus, the current state is very close to the goal state, with only one action needed to achieve the goal.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Block a is on top of block b, and both block a and block d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Block d is positioned on the table. Block b is also on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block c is already in the robot's hand, which is a good position for it to be placed on top of another block to reach the goal. Block a is clear, making it available for block c to be stacked upon, which aligns directly with the goal state where block c needs to be on top of block a. However, block d, which needs to be on top of block b in the goal state, is currently on the table and not in the correct configuration. No actions have been taken yet to move block d to its goal position on top of block b.

Rating: maybe

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(d:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 PROMPT
--------------------

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current state of the environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Block a is on top of block b, and both block a and block d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Block d is positioned on the table. Block b is also on the table. The robot hand is currently holding block c.
Valid Actions:
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state, block C must be stacked on top of block A, as specified. The valid actions include stacking C on A, which directly aligns with the goal. After placing C on A, the next step towards the goal would be to get block D on top of block B. Currently, block D is on the table and clear, so in future steps (beyond the current choices), moving D will be feasible. For now, the focus should be on correctly placing block C.

Actions: stack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A is positioned on top of block B, and block C is on top of block A. Blocks B and D are directly on the table. Block D and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block C is already positioned on top of block A, which matches part of the goal state. Block D, which is clear and on the table, needs to be placed on top of block B to achieve the full goal state. Since block D is clear and the robot hand is empty, the robot can directly pick up block D and stack it on block B without any additional moves to clear other blocks. This indicates that the current state is very close to the goal state and only requires a simple action to achieve the goal.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, which includes blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand, the current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
- Block B is directly on the table.
- Block C is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block D is on top of Block C and is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of D.
- The robot hand is empty at the moment.

This setup provides a clear overview of the vertical order of the blocks and the status of the robot hand, essential for planning the next actions to rearrange the blocks as required.
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: From the current state, the blocks are mostly arranged close to the goal configuration except for block D, which needs to be moved from the top of block C to the top of block B. To achieve this, the robot hand can use the unstack action to remove block D from on top of block C and then use the stack action to place block D on top of block B. Since block B is directly on the table and already clear, this makes the task straightforward without needing to rearrange other blocks significantly. The current configuration of the blocks and the clear status of block D facilitate a direct path towards achieving the goal state with minimal moves.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A is positioned on top of block B, and block C is on top of block A. Blocks B and D are directly on the table. Block D and block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot hand is empty at the moment.
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the configuration partially matches the goal state: block C is already on top of block A, which is one of the requirements of the goal state. However, block D, which needs to be on top of block B, is currently directly on the table and not on any block. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it can immediately perform actions like picking up block D and stacking it on block B. Since there is already a correct stack (C on A) and the robot can directly address placing D on B, the current state seems to be very close to achieving the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The blocks are situated as follows:

- Block B is on the table.
- Block C is also on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
- Block D is clear and on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block B and it is clear.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup allows for various actions like moving blocks between the table and on top of other blocks, provided the robot follows the constraints of only moving blocks that are clear and using the empty hand for picking up or stacking.
Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: From the current state, the robot can achieve the goal by performing a sequence of valid moves. First, block A is already clear and on top of block B, so no action is needed with block A for now. Block D is clear and on the table, which matches its goal state requirement of being on top of block B. Block C, which is clear and on the table, needs to be placed on top of block A. The robot's hand being empty is advantageous as it can immediately pick up block C to stack it on block A. Since there are no conflicting or obstructive placements in the current state relative to the goal state, and direct actions can be planned to reach the goal, the current state is conducive to achieving the desired goal configuration.

- unstack(d:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, which is a version of the classic Blocksworld with blocks, a table, and a robot hand, several conditions are currently met:

1. The robot hand is holding block 'd'.
2. Block 'a' is positioned on top of block 'b'.
3. Block 'c' is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block 'b' is directly on the table.
5. Block 'c' is also on top of block 'a'.

Goal State:
In this Blocks World scenario, the goal is to arrange the blocks such that block C is positioned on top of block A, and block D is on top of block B.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state described has the robot hand holding block 'd', which is necessary for placing it according to the goal. Block 'c' is already on top of block 'a', which aligns perfectly with the goal state. The only action needed to achieve the goal from the current state is to place block 'd' on top of block 'b', which is on the table and clear, making this action straightforward. Since most of the arrangement is already correct and only one simple action remains, the likelihood of reaching the goal state from the current state is very high.
