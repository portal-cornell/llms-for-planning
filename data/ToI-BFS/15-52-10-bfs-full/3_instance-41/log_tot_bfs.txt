ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(b:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, which includes blocks labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c', along with a table and a robot hand, the situation is as follows:

- Block 'b' is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.
- Block 'a' is on the table.
- Block 'b' is on top of block 'a'.
- The robot hand is holding block 'c'.

This configuration describes how each block is positioned relative to others and the table, and the status of the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block A, and block C should be stacked on top of block B. This setup forms a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block B in the middle, and block C at the top. The actions available to achieve this configuration include picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on top of another and unstacking them if necessary.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state is already quite close to the goal state in terms of the arrangement of blocks 'a' and 'b', with 'b' already on top of 'a'. The key difference is the position of block 'c', which the robot hand is currently holding. To reach the goal state, the robot hand simply needs to stack 'c' on top of 'b'. Since block 'b' is clear and the robot hand is already holding 'c', the action required to transform the current state into the goal state is straightforward and directly achievable without any additional intermediate steps.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The block 'a' is on the table and is clear with nothing on top of it. Similarly, block 'c' is also on the table and clear. The robot hand is holding block 'b'.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block A, and block C should be stacked on top of block B. This setup forms a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block B in the middle, and block C at the top. The actions available to achieve this configuration include picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on top of another and unstacking them if necessary.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block 'b' is already in the robot's hand, while blocks 'a' and 'c' are clear on the table. To reach the goal state, the next logical step in the sequence would involve placing block 'b' on block 'a', as the goal is to have 'b' directly on 'a' followed by 'c' on top of 'b'. Since 'b' is already picked up, half of the needed action (picking up 'b') is complete, and now just needs to be followed by the action stack(b, a). The subsequent action after this would then be to pick up 'c' and stack it on 'b'. Given that the robot is already holding 'b', the progression towards the goal state is straightforward and directly aligns with the required final configuration.

Rating: sure

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The block 'a' is on the table and is clear with nothing on top of it. Similarly, block 'c' is also on the table and clear. The robot hand is holding block 'b'.

Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block A, and block C should be stacked on top of block B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, followed by block B, and block C at the top. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B, and both blocks A and C are clear on the table. First, we should place block B on top of block A to start forming the base of the desired stack. From the valid actions available, 'stack(b:default,a:default)' fits this step. After this, block C can be picked up and stacked on block B, but this action isn't available directly. Thus, we need to perform the valid action of stacking B on A first.

Actions: stack(b:default,a:default), put-down(b:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. The current state of the blocks is as follows:

- Block A is located on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is also located on the table.
- Both Block B and Block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block A, and block C should be stacked on top of block B. This setup forms a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block B in the middle, and block C at the top. The actions available to achieve this configuration include picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on top of another and unstacking them if necessary.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has Block A on the table with Block B on top of it, and Block C is separately on the table. The goal state requires Block C to be stacked on top of Block B, which is already on Block A. Since Block B is already correctly positioned on Block A, the next steps would involve picking up Block C with the robot hand and stacking it on top of Block B. This progression suggests that the current state is very close to the goal state, with only one action (stacking Block C on Block B) needed to reach the goal.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are three blocks labeled as a, b, and c. The block a is positioned on the table. The block b is placed on top of block a, and block c is on top of block b. The robot's hand is currently empty, and block c is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it. This setup forms a stack with block a at the bottom, followed by block b, and block c at the top.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block A, and block C should be stacked on top of block B. This setup forms a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block B in the middle, and block C at the top. The actions available to achieve this configuration include picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on top of another and unstacking them if necessary.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state already matches the goal state description with block a at the bottom, block b in the middle, and block c on top, forming a vertical stack. The robot hand is empty, which is consistent with a completed configuration, as no further actions are necessary to rearrange the blocks. Given that the current state matches the goal state, the likelihood that this current state is on the path to the goal state is not just a possibility, it is a certainty because it is already the goal state itself.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. The current state of the blocks is as follows:

- Block A is located on the table.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block A.
- Block C is also located on the table.
- Both Block B and Block C are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or stacking blocks.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block A, and block C should be stacked on top of block B. This setup forms a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block B in the middle, and block C at the top. The actions available to achieve this configuration include picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on top of another and unstacking them if necessary.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state has Block A on the table with Block B on top of it, and Block C also on the table but clear. The goal state requires Block C to be on top of Block B, which is already on top of Block A. The robot hand is empty, which means it can immediately perform the action to pick up Block C and stack it on Block B to achieve the desired configuration. Given that no blocks need to be rearranged except for placing Block C on top of Block B, and the robot hand is ready to perform this action, the current state appears to be very close to the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there is a setup involving three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a robot hand. All three blocks, A, B, and C, are positioned on the table. Each of these blocks is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block. This setup provides a clear and accessible state for any block manipulation actions such as picking up or stacking.
Goal State:
In this scenario, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks in a specific configuration. Specifically, block B should be placed on top of block A, and block C should be stacked on top of block B. This setup forms a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block B in the middle, and block C at the top. The actions available to achieve this configuration include picking up and putting down blocks, as well as stacking one block on top of another and unstacking them if necessary.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state presents a clear groundwork where all blocks (A, B, and C) are on the table and clear, and the robot hand is empty, which is a good starting point for rearranging the blocks. Given that the goal is to stack B on A and C on B, the initial state allows for straightforward actions to achieve this stacking order without the need to unstack any pre-existing configurations. The robot can begin by picking up block B, stacking it on block A, followed by picking up block C and stacking it on block B, leading directly towards the goal state.
