[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, which includes blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and actions involving a robot hand, the following conditions are observed:

1. The robot hand is holding block A.
2. Block C is situated on top of block D.
3. Block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
4. Block D is on the table.
5. Block B is positioned on top of block C.

This setup indicates multiple stacked blocks with the robot hand actively engaged, holding block A, and several clear paths for movement or repositioning of the blocks.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block "a" positioned on top of block "d". This is within a setting involving multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state is part way to the goal, with block A already in the robot's hand, ready to be placed or stacked according to the goal requirements. Currently, block D is on the table and not under any other blocks, which is beneficial for achieving the goal. However, blocks B and C are incorrectly stacked on top of each other which does not align with the goal state. The robot needs to unstack block B from C and potentially use either block B or C as an intermediary step, or directly move towards stacking A on D. Given that A is already in the robot's hand and D is on the table and clear (not under any other block), the path towards the goal is feasible but requires a few intermediate steps.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the summary of their arrangement and status:

- Block a is on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block c is stacked on top of block d and is clear, meaning there is no block on top of c.
- Block d is on the table, but it is not clear as block c is on top of it.

This setup describes the initial or current state of the blocks, with the robot actively holding block b.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block "a" positioned on top of block "d". This is within a setting involving multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state already has block d on the table, which is a necessary condition for the goal state where block a needs to be on top of block d. However, block c is currently on top of block d and needs to be removed. The robot hand is holding block b, which is not directly involved in achieving the goal state but could be used for maneuvering other blocks. The next logical steps would be to put down block b, unstack block c from block d, and then stack block a on block d. Given the simplicity of these moves, this current state seems quite feasible for progressing toward the goal state.

The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block "a" is on top of block "d", we need to first ensure both blocks "a" and "d" are in a position to be stacked. Currently, block "a" is clear and on the table, which is perfect. However, block "d" is not clear as it has block "c" on it. The robot is also currently holding block "b". The best move might be to put down block "b" so that the hand is free to manipulate other blocks. After putting down "b", the hand can be used to unstack "c" from "d", making "d" clear.

Actions: put-down(b:default), unstack(c:default,d:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have block "a" positioned on top of block "d". Currently, block "b" is in the robot's hand and can be either put down or stacked onto another block. Given the goal, stacking "b" on "a" does not directly contribute to the final arrangement we need, which is "a" on "d". Instead, putting down "b" will free the robot's hand, allowing for subsequent moves to manipulate block "a" which is currently clear and on the table.

Actions: put-down(b:default), pick-up(a:default)

The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal of having block "a" on top of block "d", we need to first manage the current state where block "b" is held by the robot. The robot can either stack block "b" or put it down. To clear the way for manipulating block "a", which is a part of the goal state, the best initial action would be to put down block "b". After putting down "b", block "a" can be manipulated in subsequent moves to achieve the goal. However, as the robot can only perform one move at a time and "b" is currently in hand, the immediate need is to free the robot's hand by placing "b" down, potentially on the table or stacking it on another clear block not involved in the immediate goal path.

Actions: put-down(b:default), stack(b:default,c:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there is a scenario involving four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:

1. The robot hand is empty.
2. Block A is positioned on top of Block B.
3. Block B is positioned on top of Block C.
4. Block C is positioned on top of Block D.
5. Block D is on the table.
6. Block A is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.

This setup outlines the initial state of blocks in relation to each other and their placement relative to the table, as well as the status of the robot's hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block "a" positioned on top of block "d". This is within a setting involving multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have block A on top of block D. In the current state, block A is already on top of block B, which is on top of block C, and block C is on top of block D. This means all blocks are already stacked with A at the top and D at the bottom. To achieve the goal, the robot needs to unstack B from A and C from B, and then restack A directly onto D. The current state where A is clear and the robot hand is empty is conducive to starting this sequence of moves, making the transition to the goal state straightforward.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is on top of block C and it is clear.
- Block C is on top of block D.
- Block D is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks are stacked with B on C, and C on D, while blocks A and D are directly on the table. Additionally, both the top surfaces of blocks A and B are free of any other blocks, and the robot hand is not holding any blocks at the moment.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block "a" positioned on top of block "d". This is within a setting involving multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows blocks A and D already in important positions with respect to the goal state. Block A is on the table and clear, which makes it easily accessible for manipulation. Block D is also on the table and is the base for blocks C and B. To reach the goal state where block A is on top of block D, the robot would need to unstack blocks B and C from D, then either move block D to a position where block A can be stacked on top of it, or move block A to stack on top of block D. Given that the robot hand is empty, it is ready to perform these operations. The sequence of actions needed to rearrange from the current to the goal state is straightforward and feasible with the given operators.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, the robot's hand is empty, and there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here's the arrangement of these blocks:

- Block B and Block A are clear (nothing is on top of them) and placed directly on the table.
- Block C is also clear and is on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table.

This setup involves no blocks being held by the robot's hand, which is currently empty.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block "a" positioned on top of block "d". This is within a setting involving multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have block "a" on top of block "d". In the current state, block "a" (assumed to be block "A") is clear and on the table, and block "d" (assumed to be block "D") is also on the table but has block "C" on top of it. To move towards the goal state, block "C" needs to be unstacked from "D" and placed elsewhere, possibly on the table or on another block. Then, block "A" can be stacked on "D". Since the robot's hand is empty, it is immediately possible to execute these actions: unstack "C" from "D" and then stack "A" onto "D". Thus, the current state seems to be on a direct path towards the goal state with achievable actions given the rules of the environment.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot hand:

- Block A is on the table and it is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it.
- Block B is on top of block C and it is clear.
- Block C is on top of block D.
- Block D is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that blocks are stacked with B on C, and C on D, while blocks A and D are directly on the table. Additionally, both the top surfaces of blocks A and B are free of any other blocks, and the robot hand is not holding any blocks at the moment.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to have block "a" positioned on top of block "d". This is within a setting involving multiple blocks, a table, and a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The task is to rearrange the blocks so that block "a" ends up on block "d", achieving the specified configuration.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state has block A on the table and block D also on the table but with block C on top of it. To reach the goal state where block A must be on top of block D, block C needs to be moved. The robot hand being empty is optimal for starting the manipulation of the blocks. The necessary steps involve unstacking block C from D, then either placing it on the table or on another block, and finally stacking block A on block D. Given that the robot hand is empty, and block A is already clear, the environment is conducive to quickly progressing towards the goal state.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has the robot hand holding block A, which is a necessary condition to eventually place it on another block. Block D is on the table and can serve as a base. However, block B is currently on top of block C, which is on top of block D, complicating the direct placement of block A on block D. To achieve the goal, block B must be moved away from block C, and possibly block C needs to be repositioned or left as is, depending on the desired end configuration of other blocks beyond the goal of getting A on D. The robot hand being already engaged with block A is a good starting point for action towards the goal.
