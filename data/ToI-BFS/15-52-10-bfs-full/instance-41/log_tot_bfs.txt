ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(d:default)
- unstack(b:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, block A is on the table, block B is clear and is positioned on top of block C, and block C, in turn, is on top of block A. The robot hand is holding block D. This setup indicates that the blocks are stacked in a specific arrangement, with A at the bottom, C in the middle, and B at the top, while D is being held and not part of the stack.
Goal State:
The environment consists of several blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and only blocks with no other blocks on top (clear blocks) can be moved. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block D is being held by the robot hand, and the stack order from bottom to top is A, C, B. The goal state requires the blocks to be arranged with block B on top of block D and block C on top of block A. Since block A is already at the bottom in the current state and C is on top of it, part of the goal state is already met. Now, the robot hand needs to place block D on the table or directly under block B to proceed towards the goal state. Since block B is clear and on top of the stack, it can be moved easily to achieve the desired configuration with D. The robot hand being occupied with block D is crucial because it means the next steps can be directly towards rearranging D and B to reach the goal state.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block a is located on the table, and block c is positioned on top of block a. Both block d and block c are clear, indicating there are no blocks on top of them. Block b is currently being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, block d is also on the table. This setup of blocks and their positions must be maneuvered to achieve any specified goal using the robot's actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The environment consists of several blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and only blocks with no other blocks on top (clear blocks) can be moved. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state already has blocks A and C in a partial configuration that aligns with the goal state, where block C is on top of block A. The robot is currently holding block B, which is ideal because the goal requires block B to be stacked on block D. Block D is clear and on the table, so it is ready to receive block B. The current state is therefore quite close to the goal state, requiring only a few strategic moves: putting down block B on block D, and ensuring the robot's hand is empty, which aligns with the goal state's condition.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. The block a is located on the table, and block c is positioned on top of block a. Both block d and block c are clear, indicating there are no blocks on top of them. Block b is currently being held by the robot's hand. Additionally, block d is also on the table. This setup of blocks and their positions must be maneuvered to achieve any specified goal using the robot's actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Valid Actions:
- stack(b:default,c:default)
- stack(b:default,d:default)
- put-down(b:default)
Goal State:
The environment consists of several blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and only blocks with no other blocks on top (clear blocks) can be moved. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block B to be on top of block D and block C to remain on top of block A. From the current state, block B is held by the robot's hand, and block D is clear on the table. The immediate action that aligns with the goal is to place block B on top of block D. The second action should consider maintaining the position of block C on block A, which is already in place and requires no further action. Thus, the robot's hand should be emptied by putting down block B on block D, aligning perfectly with the goal state requirements.

Actions: stack(b:default,d:default), put-down(b:default)

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(d:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The layout is as follows:

- Block A is on the table.
- Block C is on top of Block A and Block C is clear.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block D and Block B is clear.
- Block D is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup describes a scenario in the Blocksworld domain where blocks are arranged in specific positions and the robot's task may involve rearranging them according to certain goals using the defined actions.
Goal State:
The environment consists of several blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and only blocks with no other blocks on top (clear blocks) can be moved. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state already meets part of the goal state requirements, where Block B is on top of Block D and Block D is on the table. Additionally, Block C is already on top of Block A, which also aligns with the goal state requirements. The robot's hand is empty, which is appropriate as no blocks need to be picked up or moved to achieve the goal state. Therefore, no further actions are required to reach the goal state from the current state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the configuration of the environment based on the given predicates:

1. Block B is on the table and it is clear, meaning no other block is on top of it.
2. Block A is also on the table.
3. Block C is stacked on top of Block A and is clear.
4. Block D is on the table and is clear.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that the blocks are positioned mostly on the table except for Block C, which is on top of Block A, and the robot's hand is not holding any block at the moment.
Goal State:
The environment consists of several blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and only blocks with no other blocks on top (clear blocks) can be moved. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The Current State shows that Block B and Block D are on the table and clear, while Block C is already on top of Block A. This setup aligns with part of the Goal State, where Block C should be on Block A. However, for the other part of the goal, Block B needs to be stacked on Block D. Both of these blocks are clear and on the table, which makes it feasible to achieve the goal by using a 'stack' action between B and D. The robot hand being empty is also favorable as it can perform necessary actions without needing to put down another block first.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d. The blocks are arranged such that:
- Block a is on the table.
- Block c is on top of block a.
- Block b is on top of block c, forming a stack.
- Block d is also on the table.

Additionally:
- Both blocks b and d are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup is part of a scenario where the goal is to reconfigure these blocks into another specified arrangement using the robot hand operations of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.
Goal State:
The environment consists of several blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and only blocks with no other blocks on top (clear blocks) can be moved. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block B is already clear, which is a necessary condition for it to be moved. Block D is also clear and on the table, making it a suitable candidate for placing block B on top of it. Block C is currently underneath block B, so it will need to be exposed by unstacking block B from block C before it can be directly placed on block A. Block A is already on the table and clear from any block above block C, making it immediately ready to support block C once block C is free. Given that the robot hand is empty, it is ready to perform any necessary action such as picking up, unstacking, or stacking.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block B is on top of Block C.
- Block C is directly on the table, and on top of Block A which is also on the table.
- Block D is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks. 

This setup outlines the current state of the blocks and the status of the robot hand in the environment.
Goal State:
The environment consists of several blocks and a table, with a robot hand that can manipulate these blocks. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table, and only blocks with no other blocks on top (clear blocks) can be moved. The robot hand can either be holding a block or be empty.

The current goal in this environment is to arrange the blocks so that block B is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state shows Block D on top of Block B, which is on top of Block C. Block C is on the table, sharing the table space with Block A. The goal state requires Block B to be on top of Block D and Block C on top of Block A. To achieve this, Block D needs to be moved from the top of Block B, and Block B must then be placed on top of Block D. This can be achieved through a series of unstacking and stacking actions, given that the robot hand is empty and ready to perform these operations. Block C and Block A are already in the correct relative positions (on the table together), but need to be stacked properly.
