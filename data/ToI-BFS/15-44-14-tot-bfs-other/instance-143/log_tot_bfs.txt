[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)
- unstack(d:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The block C is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear. Similarly, block B is also on the table. Block D is positioned on top of block B and is clear as well. The robot hand is currently holding block A. This setup forms the basis for the robot's actions to rearrange the blocks according to a specified goal.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has block A being held by the robot's hand, block B and C are on the table, and block D is on top of block B. The goal state requires block A to be at the bottom, with C on top of A, and D on top of C. Since the robot is already holding A, it can directly place A on the table. Next steps would involve clearing B and D (which is already clear) and stacking C on A, followed by stacking D on C. The current state seems conducive to achieving the goal state, with a sequence of moves that logically progresses towards the desired configuration.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks named A, B, C, and D. Block A is currently on top of Block C, and both Block B and Block C are directly on the table. Blocks A and B are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. The robot's hand is currently holding Block D. This setup indicates a scenario where block manipulation tasks such as stacking or moving might be required to achieve a specific configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block A on top of block C, and the robot hand holding block D. To achieve the goal state, block C needs to be on top of block A, with block D on top of block C. The robot's first actions should include putting down block D, then rearranging block A and C, followed by stacking block D on top of the newly positioned block C. Since the goal requires significant rearrangement but is still feasible with the described actions, it is plausible that the current state is on the path to the goal state, albeit not directly.

--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal of stacking C on A and then D on C, the first step should be to place A on the table since C needs to be stacked on A, and A is currently being held by the robot hand.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the current state where the robot hand is holding block A, and the goal to stack block C on block A, followed by block D on block C, the actions should facilitate this arrangement. The first logical step is to put block A down on the table to subsequently allow stacking of block C on block A. Next, as block C is already clear, I need to prepare for stacking it on A, which requires A to be clear as well, so putting down A is necessary before any stacking can occur.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Since the robot's hand is holding block A, the immediate action would involve either putting it down or stacking it in a position that aligns with achieving the goal state. Given the goal to have block C on top of block A, and considering block C is clear and on the table, a sensible first step is to put block A down on the table, clearing the robot's hand and preparing it for future actions such as picking up block C. Following this, the robot can then pick up block C, preparing it to be stacked on block A in subsequent actions.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the goal to stack block C on block A and then block D on block C, the robot needs to first put down block A from its hand. Currently, the robot is holding block A. Once A is on the table, the robot can then stack block C on top of block A, making progress towards the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot is holding block A, and the goal is to stack block C on A and then stack D on C. First, block A should be placed on the table to enable the configuration of stacking C on A later. Once A is on the table, block C, which is already clear and on the table, can be stacked on A.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block C is on top of block A, and block D is on top of block C, the robot must first place block A down since it's currently holding it. The action 'put-down(a:default)' is valid and crucial because it allows block A to be placed on the table, making it available to have other blocks stacked on it. After this, the action 'stack(c:default,a:default)' (although not listed in the valid actions and was attempted previously) would be the next logical step to move towards the goal. However, since block C is already on the table and 'stack(c:default,a:default)' is not an available action, I will focus on the valid actions provided. The next best step is to prepare for stacking by using the action 'stack(a:default,d:default)', which will position block A under block D, allowing future steps to align with the goal structure once block C can be moved appropriately.

Actions: put-down(a:default), stack(a:default,d:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state of having block C on top of block A, and block D on top of block C, the robot's hand must first be empty to manipulate other blocks. Since the robot is currently holding block D, the first action should involve placing D down in a position that does not conflict with future moves. Placing D on block B seems appropriate, as it doesn't interfere with the movement of blocks A and C. After this, block A can be unstacked from block C, allowing block C to be moved freely.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block D is directly on top of block C, which is on top of block A, we need to reposition block D. Currently, D is held by the robot's hand. Given the valid actions, I can either put D down or stack it on block A or B. Stacking D on block A progresses towards the goal configuration by moving D into a position where it can later be moved onto C after repositioning C on A. 

Following this, block C should be placed on block A. However, since block A is currently on C, we need to reposition A first, but the valid actions do not directly allow for this currently. Therefore, the most immediate feasible action is to place D on block A, preparing D for the future stacking once block C is positioned correctly.

Actions: stack(d:default,a:default), put-down(d:default)

Current State:
In the current scenario within a Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the configuration and status of these items:

1. Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
2. Block C is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block B is also positioned on the table.
4. Block D is clear.
5. Block A is clear and positioned on the table.
6. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the initial or current state of the environment involving the blocks, their placement, and the status of the robotic hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: To evaluate the likelihood of the current state being on the path to the goal state, it is essential to consider the steps needed to achieve the goal configuration. The goal is to have a stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D on the top. In the current state, block A and block C are clear and on the table, whereas block D is on top of block B, which is also on the table. The first step would involve unstacking block D from block B, making both blocks clear. Subsequently, block C can be stacked on block A, and finally, block D can be stacked on block C. The robot’s hand being empty is advantageous as it is ready to perform operations such as picking up or unstacking blocks. The current state indeed has all the necessary components clear or easily made clear for repositioning, making it feasible to rearrange them to achieve the goal state.

2. The robot’s hand is empty.
3. Block A is clear and positioned on top of Block D.
4. Block B is on the table.
5. Block D is placed on top of Block B.

This setup forms a stack with Blocks D and B at the base, and Block A on top of this stack, while Block C is independently on the table.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block C is already clear and on the table, which is a good setup since Block C needs to be moved on top of Block A eventually. Block A is currently on top of Block D, which needs to be reversed in the goal state where Block D should be on top of Block C. The robot hand is empty, so it's ready to perform operations such as unstacking and stacking. The goal requires repositioning Block D and stacking in a particular order, which is feasible from the current state but requires several moves. The initial state does not contradict the goal state's requirements; it only requires a sequence of correct operations.

In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A is positioned on top of block C, and block D is on top of block A. Block C is directly on the table. Block B is also on the table and is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Block D is clear as well. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks at this moment.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block A is on top of C and block D is on top of A. This partially matches the goal state of having a stack with A at the bottom, C in the middle, and D at the top. The robot needs to perform a sequence of actions to reposition the blocks to reach the goal. The hand is empty, which is advantageous as it allows for immediate action. The only difference from the goal state is that block C needs to be directly on top of block A, instead of having block A on top of C. This can be achieved by unstacking D from A and then A from C, then stacking C on A, and finally D on C.

Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state from the current state, the robot needs to rearrange the blocks so that A is at the bottom, C is in the middle, and D is on top. Currently, A is on top of C, which is the opposite of part of the desired configuration. To move towards the goal:
1. Unstack block A from C and place A on the table.
2. Pick up block D and stack it on top of block C.
3. Finally, pick up block A again and stack it under C.

The current configuration does not directly match the goal but does contain all necessary elements in a state that allows for reconfiguration to meet the goal. The sequence of required moves is straightforward, indicating that the current state is indeed on the path to achieving the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state of having block C on top of block A and block D on top of block C, the first step is to get block A clear so that other blocks can be stacked on it. Currently, block A is stacked on block C, so the immediate action should be to separate these blocks. The valid action to do this is unstacking A from C. Once A is on the table and clear, subsequent actions can focus on rearranging C and D as required.

Actions: unstack(a:default,c:default), pick-up(d:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario, there are four objects identified as blocks labeled 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Each of these blocks is positioned on the table, and they are all clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot hand is currently holding block 'd'. This setup is part of a Blocks World environment where the goal is typically to rearrange these blocks into a specific configuration using a robot hand that can pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has all blocks on the table except for block 'd', which is held by the robot hand. This configuration is potentially beneficial because block 'd' is already in the hand, which is necessary to eventually place it on top of block 'c' as described in the goal state. However, since block 'c' is not yet on block 'a', additional actions are required to move block 'c' onto block 'a' before placing block 'd' on top of block 'c'. The steps needed include putting down block 'd', moving block 'c' onto block 'a', and then picking up and stacking block 'd' on block 'c'. Considering these factors, the current state could be on the path to the goal state, assuming efficient and correct actions are taken next.

- Block b is also on the table.
- Block d is placed on top of block b, and it is clear as nothing is stacked on it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c. 

This setup involves direct interactions and placements of blocks in relation to each other and the table, with the robot's involvement in manipulating these blocks.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state presents a scenario where block c is held by the robot hand, block a is clear, and block d is stacked on block b but also clear. The goal state requires block c to be on top of block a and block d on top of block c. Since block c is already in the robot's hand, the robot can directly place c on a. The next step would be unstacking block d from b and stacking it on c. The current configuration allows these actions to be performed without needing to move any unrelated blocks out of the way or perform extra steps that deviate from the direct path to the goal configuration.

VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state involves the robot's hand holding Block D, with Block A on top of Block C and both A and B clear. The goal is to have Block C on Block A and Block D on Block C. Given that the robot is already holding Block D, it can directly proceed by stacking Block D on Block C after Block C is moved on top of Block A. Therefore, transitioning Block C to be on A requires unstacking A from C, placing A somewhere (either on the table or on B), picking up C (if it's not already held after unstacking), and then stacking C on A. Since the robot is already holding D, this state is certainly conducive to quick reconfiguration to achieve the goal.

The robot is currently holding block C, and since one of the valid actions is to stack C on A, this action aligns perfectly with our goal. After having C on A, the next step in future actions would be to rearrange block D to stack it on C, but currently, D is on B. However, the valid actions do not include moving D directly, so the only feasible action for now is to stack C on A.

Actions: stack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default)

Actions:
- stack(d:default,b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within the Blocks world, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The arrangement and status of these blocks are as follows:

- Block C is clear and placed directly on top of Block A.
- Block A is situated on the table.
- Block D is clear and positioned directly on top of Block B.
- Block B is also on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that the blocks are stacked in two groups, with Block C on Block A and Block D on Block B, both of which are resting on the table. The robot is ready to perform actions since its hand is empty.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: From the current state, the goal is to create a vertical stack where block A is at the bottom, followed by block C, and then block D on the top. Currently, block C is already on block A, which aligns with part of the goal state. However, block D is on block B and needs to be moved onto block C. The robot hand is empty, which is beneficial as it can perform actions such as unstacking block D from block B and then stacking it on block C. Since the current state already has part of the formation desired in the goal state and the necessary actions to rearrange the blocks are straightforward with the current state of the robot's hand, the likelihood of reaching the goal state from the current state is high.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current scenario within a Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the configuration and status of these items:

1. Block D is stacked on top of Block B.
2. Block C is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block B is also positioned on the table.
4. Block D is clear.
5. Block A is clear and positioned on the table.
6. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup outlines the initial or current state of the environment involving the blocks, their placement, and the status of the robotic hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where Block A is at the bottom, Block C is in the middle, and Block D is on top, the current configuration needs some changes. Currently, Block D is on Block B, Block C is clear on the table, and Block A is also clear on the table. Since the robot hand is empty, the robot can start by moving Block D off of Block B, placing it temporarily on the table or holding it. Then the robot can stack Block C on Block A. After that, Block D can be placed on top of Block C. The current state has all blocks clear except for Block B which is under D, and the necessary blocks (C and A) are already in positions where they can be easily manipulated to start forming the stack. The current state allows for straightforward actions to transition towards the goal state.
Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. Both blocks C and B are positioned on the table. The robot's hand is empty at the moment. Additionally, both blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks A and C in an incorrect configuration, with A on top of C, whereas the goal state requires C to be on top of A. Block D is already on top of B, so it is partially in a useful position since it ultimately needs to be on top of C. The robot hand being empty is beneficial as it can perform actions such as unstacking or picking up necessary blocks. The necessary steps from the current state would involve unstacking A from C, then potentially moving D (after unstacking from B) directly on C, and finally stacking C on A. Given these actions are feasible with the current setup, the current state seems to be on the path to the goal state, though several moves are required.

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks and their status are as follows:

- Block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.
- Block B is also clear and it is placed on the table.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block A.
- Block A is placed directly on the table.

This setup outlines the spatial arrangement and the status of each object, which is crucial for planning the robot's actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block C is already on top of Block A, which is a part of the desired goal state. The robot hand is holding Block D, which is also advantageous as the next step involves placing Block D on top of Block C to complete the goal state configuration. Given that the robot hand is already holding Block D and Block C is clear, the robot can directly perform the action to stack Block D on Block C, moving closer to the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four objects named a, b, c, and d. Here's the configuration of these objects and their relationships:

- Block a is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block b is also on the table.
- Block d is placed on top of block b, and it is clear as nothing is stacked on it.
- The robot hand is currently holding block c. 

This setup involves direct interactions and placements of blocks in relation to each other and the table, with the robot's involvement in manipulating these blocks.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block c, which is a positive step towards achieving the goal state since block c needs to be placed directly on block a to form part of the desired stack. Block a is clear and on the table, making it ready to receive block c. However, block d, which needs to be on top of block c in the goal state, is currently on block b. This means that block d needs to be moved off block b and later placed on block c after it is stacked on block a. The robot's next actions should involve putting down block c on block a and subsequently moving block d.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The block C is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear. Similarly, block B is also on the table. Block D is positioned on top of block B and is clear as well. The robot hand is currently holding block A. This setup forms the basis for the robot's actions to rearrange the blocks according to a specified goal.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The robot is currently holding block A, and the goal requires block A to be at the bottom of a stack. Since block A is already in the robot's hand, the robot can directly place it on the table, making it possible to subsequently stack block C and then block D on top of it. Block B's position on the table does not interfere with achieving the goal state as it is not mentioned in the goal state configuration. The current state thus facilitates a straightforward path to the goal state by simply placing block A down, picking up block C, stacking it on A, then picking up block D and stacking it on C.

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks and their status are as follows:

- Block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.
- Block B is also clear and it is placed on the table.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block A.
- Block A is placed directly on the table.

This setup outlines the spatial arrangement and the status of each object, which is crucial for planning the robot's actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Valid Actions:

- put-down(d:default)
- stack(d:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block D needs to be stacked on top of block C, and given that block C is already on top of block A, the actions need to directly address the position of block D. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D, and block C is clear and positioned correctly on top of block A. Therefore, the most straightforward approach is to stack block D directly on block C to move closer to achieving the goal configuration.

Actions: stack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(a:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here's the setup of the blocks and their status:

- Block a is on the table.
- Block b is also on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block c is on top of block a.
- Block d is on top of block c and is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment, indicating it's not holding any blocks. This setup of blocks and the status of the robot's hand constitute the current state of the environment.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state specifies that block C should be directly on top of block A, and block D should be directly on top of block C. In the current state, block C is already on top of block A, which is a part of the desired goal. Block D is also on top of block C, completing the configuration as described in the goal state. The robot hand being empty does not affect the achievement of the goal state since no further block manipulation is required to meet the goal. Therefore, the current state already matches the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the summary of the environment's state:

- Block C is on top of Block A and Block C is clear, meaning there is no block on top of Block C.
- Block D is clear and placed directly on the table.
- Block B is also clear and on the table.
- Block A is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.

This setup allows for several possible actions including moving the clear blocks or picking up any block that is clear using the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state is very close to the goal state, with only one key action missing to achieve the goal. Specifically, Block C is already on top of Block A, and both Block D and Block B are clear and on the table. The robot hand is empty, which is ideal for executing the required actions. The only action needed to achieve the goal state from the current state is to "stack Block D on top of Block C." Since Block D is clear and on the table, and Block C is also clear, this action is straightforward and feasible.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment setup, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B. Both blocks C and B are positioned on the table. The robot's hand is empty at the moment. Additionally, both blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
Goal State:
In this environment, the goal is to arrange a set of blocks such that block C is directly on top of block A, and block D is directly on top of block C. This will form a vertical stack with block A at the bottom, block C in the middle, and block D at the top.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block A is on top of block C, and block D is on top of block B, with both blocks B and C on the table. The goal state requires block C to be on top of block A, which means block A needs to be moved from its current position. Block D, currently on top of block B, must also be relocated to be on top of block C to form the desired vertical stack. The robot's hand is empty, which is a favorable condition for initiating moves such as picking up or unstacking blocks. The next logical steps could involve unstacking block A from C, placing it on the table, and then repositioning block C on top of A, followed by stacking block D on top of C. Although the blocks need reordering, the current state has all elements necessary and is arranged in a way that no block needs to be relocated to a completely irrelevant position. Thus, the current configuration does not present contradictions to the goal state and can be seen as a preliminary stage in the sequence of achieving the final goal configuration.
