ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(c:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Currently, block 'b' is being held by the robot's hand. Block 'c' is clear, which means there are no blocks on top of it. Block 'c' is positioned on top of block 'a', indicating a stack configuration. Additionally, block 'a' is directly on the table. This setup forms part of an initial state in a scenario where the robot can manipulate these blocks to achieve a desired configuration through a series of actions.
Goal State:
In this environment, we have several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. The robot hand meanwhile can either hold a single block or be empty.

The goal here is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block 'b' is being held by the robot's hand, and block 'c' is already clear and on top of block 'a', which is on the table. Since the goal state requires block 'b' to be directly on top of block 'c', the robot can directly perform the action stack(b,c) to place 'b' onto 'c'. This step would achieve the goal state as described, assuming no further configuration details are specified. Therefore, it seems that the current state is effectively aligned with the necessary actions to reach the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block C. Blocks A and B are both on the table and clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. This setup involves three blocks labeled as A, B, and C.
Goal State:
In this environment, we have several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. The robot hand meanwhile can either hold a single block or be empty.

The goal here is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block C, and both blocks A and B are on the table and clear. To achieve the goal state where block B is on top of block C, the robot hand needs to first put down block C onto the table and then pick up block B to stack it on block C. The current state is advantageous because block C is already in the robot hand, which is a necessary step towards placing block B on top of it. Therefore, the current setup is conducive to achieving the desired arrangement of blocks.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(b:default)
- stack(b:default,c:default)


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 PROMPT
--------------------

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the current environment, the robot hand is holding block C. Blocks A and B are both on the table and clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. This setup involves three blocks labeled as A, B, and C.
Valid Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,b:default)
Goal State:
In this environment, we have several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. The robot hand meanwhile can either hold a single block or be empty.

The goal here is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c', the robot hand, currently holding block 'C', needs to first put down block 'C' and then stack block 'B' on top of it. Among the valid actions, "put-down(c:default)" allows the robot to put down block 'C', and then "stack(c:default,b:default)" can be used to place block 'B' on top of block 'C'. This sequence of actions will directly lead us towards the desired goal state.

Actions: put-down(c:default), stack(c:default,b:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these objects is as follows:

- Block C is clear and placed on top of Block A.
- Block B is clear and placed on the table.
- Block A is also on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms the basis for the robot to perform actions such as moving blocks according to specific goals, possibly by stacking or unstacking them to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In this environment, we have several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. The robot hand meanwhile can either hold a single block or be empty.

The goal here is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block C is already on the table and has Block A on top of it. Block B is clear and also on the table. To achieve the goal state where Block B is on top of Block C, the robot needs to unstack Block A from Block C and then stack Block B on Block C. The current configuration allows for these actions to be executed since Block B is clear and can be picked up to be stacked on Block C once Block A is moved. The robot hand being empty is also conducive to performing these actions without needing to put down any block first.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block B is clear and is positioned on top of block C. Block C is situated on top of block A, which is placed directly on the table. The robot hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
In this environment, we have several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. The robot hand meanwhile can either hold a single block or be empty.

The goal here is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state presents blocks A, B, and C in a vertical stack (C on A, B on C) with an empty robot hand. The goal is to have block B directly on top of block C. Given that B is already on C, the primary requirement of the goal state is met. However, the goal does not specify the position of block A, so its placement under C does not conflict with achieving the goal. Therefore, the current arrangement of blocks appears to align with the goal condition, assuming no additional specifications (like the position of block A or whether any blocks should be on the table or in the hand).

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C. Currently, all these blocks are placed on the table and each of them is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty. This setup allows for any of the blocks to be picked up or manipulated without needing to move other blocks first.
Goal State:
In this environment, we have several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. The robot hand meanwhile can either hold a single block or be empty.

The goal here is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state has all blocks A, B, and C clear on the table and the robot's hand is empty. This setup is flexible and allows for any block to be manipulated without restrictions. The goal is to have block B on top of block C. From the current state, the robot can directly pick up block B and stack it on block C using the actions "pick-up(B)" followed by "stack(B,C)". Since all actions needed to achieve the goal can be directly executed from the current state, it is highly likely that the current state is on the path to achieving the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are three blocks labeled as A, B, and C, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the status of each element:

1. Block C is on top of Block B and Block C is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
2. Block A is clear and placed directly on the table.
3. Block B is also directly on the table.
4. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any blocks.

This setup indicates a scenario where the blocks are partially stacked and the robot hand is available to manipulate these blocks as needed.
Goal State:
In this environment, we have several blocks, a table, and a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks. The blocks can either be placed on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if no other block is on top of it. The robot hand meanwhile can either hold a single block or be empty.

The goal here is to arrange the blocks in such a way that block 'b' is directly on top of block 'c'.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block C is on top of block B and block A is on the table. The robot hand is empty, which is good for manipulation. To achieve the goal state where block B is on top of block C, a series of actions need to be performed:
1. Unstack block C from block B.
2. Put down block C on the table.
3. Pick up block B and stack it on block C.

Since block C is already clear and the robot hand is empty, the first action (unstacking C from B) can be directly executed, followed by the other necessary steps. The current state provides a setup conducive to rearranging the blocks as required by the goal state with minimal intermediate steps.
