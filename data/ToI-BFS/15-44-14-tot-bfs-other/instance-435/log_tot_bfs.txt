VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the given environment, which consists of blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a robot hand capable of manipulating these blocks, the current state can be described as follows:

- Block d is on the table.
- Block c is directly on top of block d.
- The robot hand is currently holding block a.
- Block b is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.
- Block b is positioned on top of block c.

This setup involves a vertical arrangement of blocks with b at the top, followed by c and d, and finally d resting on the table. The robot hand's involvement with block a indicates active manipulation, likely moving or having just moved block a.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state described involves the robot hand holding block a, while block b is on top of c, and c is on top of d. For the goal state, block a needs to be placed on top of block d, and c on top of a. The robot hand holding block a is a move in the right direction, as it will facilitate placing a on d. However, block b is currently on top of c, which means it needs to be moved for c to be placed on a later. This indicates that while not all conditions for the goal state are met, the state is somewhat aligned towards achieving the goal with further actions needed to rearrange b and c.

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of the blocks and the robot hand's status are as follows:

- Block A is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is stacked on top of Block C and is also clear, indicating nothing is on top of it.
- Block C is directly on top of Block D.
- Block D is on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup forms a vertical arrangement where Block D is at the base on the table, Block C is above D, and Block B is at the top above Block C, while Block A is separately on the table. The clear status of Blocks A and B indicates that these blocks can be moved by the robot hand if needed.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block D, and block C on top of block A, the current configuration needs significant rearranging. The current state has block A clear and on the table, which aligns with it needing to be moved. Block D is also on the table and under block C, which is a good start because block A needs to be stacked on block D. Block B needs to be moved from its current position on top of block C to potentially free up block C. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it can immediately be used to rearrange the blocks. The steps needed might include moving block B, stacking block A on block D, and then stacking block C on block A. Given this, the current state does seem to be on a path that could logically lead to the goal state with a series of the correct actions.

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Here is the configuration and status of these blocks and the robot hand:

1. Block c is placed on top of block d.
2. Block d is positioned on the table.
3. Block a is on top of block b.
4. Block b is stacked on top of block c.
5. The robot hand is currently empty.
6. Block a is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it.

This setup indicates a tower formation where blocks d, c, b, and a are stacked sequentially from the table upwards, with block a being the topmost and clear. The robot hand is available to manipulate any of the blocks, starting ideally with block a since it is clear.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has block a on top of block b, which is on top of block c, and block c on top of block d. The goal state requires block a on top of block d and block c on top of block a. To transition from the current state to the goal state, the robot hand can be used to rearrange these blocks. The current arrangement of blocks does not directly match the goal; however, it includes all necessary elements. The robot hand being empty is an advantageous starting point as it can immediately begin operations like unstacking and restacking to achieve the desired configuration. The sequence might involve unstacking block a from b, then unstacking block b from c, followed by stacking operations to achieve the goal configuration. Hence, the current state appears to be a viable starting point though it requires multiple steps to reach the goal.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block a, which is a crucial step towards achieving the goal state where block a must be placed on top of block d. Block c is currently on top of block d, which will need to be moved to achieve the goal of stacking block c on top of block a. Since block b is clear and on top of block c, it could be moved without directly interfering with the arrangement of a, c, and d as required in the goal state. Therefore, the current state potentially aligns with necessary preliminary steps towards repositioning the blocks as specified in the goal.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the current state where the robot hand is holding block 'b', and the goal is to have 'a' on top of 'd' and 'c' on top of 'a', the robot's immediate concern should be to place 'b' in such a way that it does not interfere with the placement of other blocks according to the goal. The robot can either put 'b' down or stack it on 'c' or 'a'. Placing 'b' on 'a' now will not interfere with the goal as 'a' needs to be eventually moved on top of 'd' and then 'c' on top of 'a'. This would free up the robot's hand for the next steps, which might involve manipulating 'a' and 'd'.

The goal is for block A to be on top of block D and block C to be on top of block A. To reach the goal state from the current state, the robot hand can perform a series of actions: unstack block B from A, put down B, unstack C from D, stack C on A, and finally stack A on D.

The initial setup is conducive to reaching the goal because block d is already on the table and clear (except for block c), making it easy to stack block a on block d as required. Block c, which needs to end up on block a, is already clear, and can be moved directly once block a is in place. The only intermediate actions needed are to move block c temporarily (since it is currently on block d) to allow stacking block a on block d, then placing block c on block a. The robot hand being empty is beneficial as it can immediately perform the needed actions without having to put down another block first.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block D and block C on top of block A, I need to first clear the blocks that will form the base of this configuration. Since block C is on top of block D, I should start by unstacking block C from block D. This will make block D clear, which is necessary before stacking block A on it. Once block C is unstacked and the robot hand is holding it, the next move should involve picking up block A, as it is clear and on the table, preparing it for the subsequent stacking action in future steps.

Think: The goal is to have a stack of A on D and then C on A. Currently, A is on the table with B on top of it, D is clear on the table, and C is in the robot's hand. To move toward the goal state, the robot must first put down C, then unstack B from A to clear A. After clearing A, the robot can stack A on D. Finally, C can be picked up again and stacked on A.

Given this configuration, the current state is somewhat aligned as 'd' is already at the bottom, which is required in the goal state. However, 'b' being in the hand and 'c' on 'd' need to be rearranged to achieve the goal state. The robot can put down 'b', pick up 'a', and then stack 'a' on 'd'.

Think: The current state with the robot hand holding block C is a good starting point. Since the goal state requires block C to be placed on top of block A, which is currently clear, the robot can directly proceed to stack block C on block A.

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding Block A, which is directly needed for achieving the goal state where Block A should be placed on top of Block D. Since Block D is already on the table and clear (with only Block C on it), the robot can directly perform the action stack(A, D) after unstacking Block C from Block D.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A needs to be on top of block D and block C on top of block A, the current state with A held by the robot needs to be arranged accordingly.

Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Since the robot hand is currently holding Block A and the goal is to have Block A on top of Block D, the direct stacking of Block A on Block D is not currently a valid action due to Block C being on Block D. The first action should involve freeing up Block D to allow for stacking Block A on it later. Since Block C is on Block D, we can utilize Block B, which is clear and on the table, as an intermediary position. The valid action right now is to stack Block A on Block B to clear the robot hand, and then potentially in subsequent steps, Block C can be moved or Block A can be rearranged as needed.

Actions: stack(a:default,b:default), put-down(a:default)

VALUE PROMPT 1

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, block C is on top of block A, while blocks B, D, and A are directly on the table. Blocks B, C, and D are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on them. The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform actions such as picking up or manipulating the blocks.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block C is already clear and on top of block A, which is a partial achievement towards the goal. However, block A is currently on the table and needs to be moved on top of block D. Since block D is also clear and on the table, this is a feasible next step. The robot's hand is empty, which is necessary for it to start manipulating the blocks. By performing actions such as picking up block A and stacking it on block D, followed by placing block C on top of block A, the goal can be reached. The current state, therefore, seems to be on a path that could logically lead to the goal state with a series of correct moves.

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four objects labeled as blocks: A, B, C, and D. All these blocks are currently placed on the table. Each block is clear, meaning that no other block is stacked on top of any of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block. The scenario is set for the robot to potentially perform actions to rearrange the blocks as needed.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has all blocks (A, B, C, D) on the table and clear, with the robot hand empty. This setup provides maximum flexibility for any block manipulation. The goal state requires A on D and C on A. From the current state, the robot can easily pick up block A (since it's clear) and stack it on block D. Following this, block C, which is also clear and on the table, can be stacked on block A. Thus, the operations required to reach the goal from the current state are straightforward and involve direct stacking actions which are fully supported by the current setup.

In the given Blocksworld environment, the state can be described as follows:

- Block `c` is clear and positioned on top of Block `d`.
- Block `d` is located on the table.
- Block `b` is also on the table.
- Block `a` is on top of Block `b` and is clear.
- The robot's hand is empty.

These details represent the current configuration of blocks `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` relative to each other and the table, along with the status of the robot's hand.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that blocks `a` and `c` are already clear, which are the blocks needed for manipulation according to the goal state. Block `d` is already on the table and can serve as a base for stacking `a`. However, block `c` needs to be moved from its current position on `d` and then after placing `a` on `d`, `c` can be stacked on `a`. Since the robot’s hand is empty, the next moves can be planned directly. The proximity of the required moves and the availability of the robot's hand suggest that the current state is favorably aligned towards achieving the goal state.

In the current environment configuration of the Blocksworld domain, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d, and a robot hand. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- Block c is directly on top of block d.
- Blocks a, b, and d are each on the table.
- Blocks a, b, and c are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.
- The robot hand is currently empty and not holding any blocks.

This setup is a starting point for the robot to perform operations such as picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks to achieve a desired configuration.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.

Think: In the current state, blocks a, b, and d are on the table and clear, while block c is on top of block d and also clear. The robot hand is empty. The goal is to have block a on top of block d and block c on top of block a. Given that block a and block d are already on the table and clear, the robot can directly stack block a on block d. After achieving this, the robot can then pick up block c (since it is clear) and stack it on block a, achieving the goal configuration. The sequence of actions required to transition from the current state to the goal state is straightforward and feasible.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block D and block C is on top of block A, we first need to handle block A or block D since they are part of the base configuration needed to stack block C. The robot's hand is currently empty, so the first logical step is to pick up block A or D. Picking up block A first seems to be a strategic move since it will be involved in both required stacks (A on D and C on A).

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows all blocks clear and the robot hand is holding block A. The goal state requires block A to be stacked on block D, with block C on top of block A. Given that the robot hand is already holding A, the next logical steps would involve placing A on D (stack(A, D)) and then picking up C and placing it on A (pick-up(C) followed by stack(C, A)). The clear status of all blocks and the position of the robot hand holding A make it straightforward to execute these steps, suggesting a clear path to the goal.

Current State:
In the described environment, we have four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Each block is currently on the table and clear, indicating that there are no blocks stacked on top of them.

Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that block D is being held by the robot, which is a positive start since D needs to be the base for block A in the goal configuration. Blocks A, B, and C are clear and on the table, which gives flexibility for further action without needing to unstack any blocks. The hand holding D suggests that the next steps could involve either placing D back on the table or directly stacking it under A if A is picked up next. Thus, the current state is conducive to progressing towards the goal, provided the next actions are strategically chosen, specifically focusing on placing D as the base and then stacking A over D followed by C over A.

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block c, and blocks a, b, and d are on the table with block a on top of b. The goal is to have block c on top of block a, which is on top of block d. The robot's current holding of block c is advantageous because the next actions can involve placing block c down temporarily to rearrange blocks a and d. Block a will need to be unstacked from b and then stacked on d. Finally, c can be stacked on a once it is on d. The current state seems to be on a potential path to achieving the goal state since it allows for these actions to be executed in a reasonable sequence.

Think: The current state has the robot hand holding Block A, which is a positive step towards achieving the goal state where Block A needs to be stacked on Block D. Blocks B and D are clear and on the table, which is useful because Block D needs to be clear to have Block A placed on top of it, which is already the case. After placing Block A on Block D, the next step would involve stacking Block C on top of Block A. Currently, Block C is clear and on top of Block D, which means it needs to be moved before placing Block A on D, but since it is already clear, it can be moved directly without additional steps to clear it.

Think: To progress toward the goal state where block A is on top of block D and block C is on top of A, the first step is to stack block A on block D using the action 'stack(a:default,d:default)'. This action directly contributes to the goal configuration. After that, block C, which is currently on the table and clear, can be stacked on block A using 'stack(c:default,a:default)'.

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block A needs to be on top of block D and block C needs to be on top of block A, we should first use the available action to place block A on block D. This sets up part of the goal state. The next step would involve picking up block C (when it becomes a valid action in a future state) and stacking it on block A.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block A is on top of block D, and block C is on top of block A, I need to consider the actions that will help me stack the blocks in this specific order. Since the robot is currently holding block D, I can use it to begin constructing the desired stack. The first action should involve placing block D in a position that will allow block A to be stacked on top of it next. Hence, putting down block D will be a strategic move.

Think: Given that the robot hand is currently holding block d and the goal is to have block A on top of block D, and then block C on top of block A, an appropriate sequence of actions would be to place block D somewhere where it can later support block A. Since block D is in hand, it can be either put down on the table or stacked directly. Since stacking block A on D is part of the goal, it makes sense to put block D down first and then pick up block A to stack on D in subsequent steps. However, picking up block A is not in the current valid actions, so the best approach right now is to put block D down and then the actions required to pick and stack A on D will need to be considered in future steps.

To achieve the goal state, the actions required would involve unstacking D from A, then stacking A on D, and finally stacking C on A. The current state does not align directly with these requirements and will require multiple correct actions to transition into the goal state.

Valid Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)
- pick-up(c:default)
- unstack(a:default,d:default)
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have block A on block D, and block C on top of block A. In the current state, block A is already on block D, which is correct. However, block C needs to be stacked on top of block A. Since the robot's hand is empty, the first action should be to pick up block C from the table. After picking up block C, the next logical step is to stack it on top of block A, which aligns directly with achieving the goal state.

Actions: pick-up(c:default), stack(c:default,a:default)

In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Since the current state has block A already on top of block D, the next steps should focus on positioning block C on top of block A as specified in the goal state. Currently, both blocks C and B are clear and on the table, and the robot's hand is empty. The valid actions include picking up block B or C, or unstacking A from D. To align with the goal, the best move is to pick up block C and prepare to stack it on A. Since the action to stack C on A directly is not available, first picking up C is necessary.

Actions: pick-up(c:default), unstack(a:default,d:default)

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current state of these objects:

- Blocks C and D are on the table and have nothing on top of them, making them clear.
- Block B is also on the table and clear.
- The robot hand is currently holding block A.

This setup indicates all blocks are either on the table or being held, with no blocks stacked on top of one another.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has all blocks either on the table or in the robot hand, which is a neutral and flexible starting point. The robot hand is holding Block A, which is advantageous since Block A is part of the goal configuration where it needs to be stacked on Block D. The next logical step would be to put down Block A on the table, and then stack Block C on Block A, followed by stacking Block A on Block D. This sequence of actions is straightforward and directly leads towards the goal state.

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. The robot hand is currently holding block B. Blocks A, C, and D are placed directly on the table. Each of these blocks (A, C, D) is clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them, allowing for potential manipulation or movement by the robot hand.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state features the robot hand holding block B, and blocks A, C, and D clear on the table. The goal state requires block A to be on block D and block C on block A. Since block B is already in the robot hand, the hand can place B on the table or stack it on another block. The pathway to the goal involves stacking blocks A and C, but since block D needs to be at the bottom of the stack, it might be beneficial to place B on the table, freeing the hand to manipulate A and C. Overall, the current configuration, with all blocks accessible and the robot hand engaged, suggests a potential pathway towards the desired goal state.

In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block C, and blocks A, B, and D are on the table and clear. To reach the goal state, the robot will need to place block C on top of block A, and block A on top of block D. First, block A needs to be stacked on block D. Since block A is already clear, the robot can directly perform this action. Next, the robot needs to stack block C on top of block A. Since the robot is already holding block C, it can directly execute this action after stacking block A on D. The current state allows for these actions without any unnecessary steps, suggesting it is directly on the path to achieving the goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block A, which is already on top of block D, the series of actions should involve placing block C on block A. Currently, the robot hand is holding block C, and block A is clear and positioned on block D, making it possible to execute the stack action directly. The first action should be to stack block C on block A. This aligns with the goal configuration and uses the correct action from the valid actions list.

Actions: stack(c:default,a:default), put-down(c:default)

In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of these blocks and their status is as follows:

- Block A is placed on top of Block D.
- Block B is directly on the table.
- Block C is positioned on top of Block A.
- Block D is also positioned directly on the table.

Furthermore, both Blocks B and C are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them and they are available for manipulation. The robot's hand is currently empty, indicating it is not holding any of the blocks. This setup is crucial for planning actions such as moving blocks or changing their arrangement.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state closely matches the goal state description. Block A is already on top of Block D, and Block C is on top of Block A. This is precisely the arrangement required in the goal state. Since the robot hand is empty, no further actions like picking up or putting down are needed to reach the goal state. The system is essentially already in the goal state, so it is definitely on the path to achieving the goal.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows Block A already on top of Block D, which is exactly in the configuration partially required in the goal state. The next steps would likely involve the robot using its actions to stack Block C on top of Block A. Since the robot's hand is empty, it is ready to pick up Block C. Given that Block C is clear and on the table, it can be easily picked up and stacked on Block A. The setup in the current state is conducive to reaching the goal state with minimal moves.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The present configuration of these blocks and the status of the robot's hand are as follows:

1. Block C is on the table and has nothing on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block D is also on the table and is clear.
3. Block B is on the table.
4. Block A is stacked on top of Block B and is clear.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that both Blocks C and D are positioned directly on the table and are free from any other blocks above them, allowing for potential movement. Block A, while stacked on Block B, is also clear and can be moved. The robot’s hand being empty is ready to perform actions such as picking up a block or stacking one block onto another.
Goal State:
In the given Blocksworld environment, the goal is to rearrange the blocks such that block A is placed on top of block D, and block C is placed on top of block A. This configuration involves stacking the blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired end state.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current configuration, Block A is on top of Block B, and both Blocks C and D are clear on the table. The goal is to have a stack where Block C is on top of Block A, which is on top of Block D. To reach this goal from the current state, the following steps would be required:
1. Unstack Block A from Block B.
2. Put down Block A on the table.
3. Pick up Block A and stack it on Block D.
4. Pick up Block C and stack it on Block A.
The robot's hand is already empty, which is suitable for picking up blocks. The current state allows for these actions since Blocks C and D are clear and accessible, and Block A can be easily unstacked from B and moved. Therefore, the current state facilitates progression towards the goal state through a series of logical steps.

Current State:
In the described Blocks World environment, four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D are positioned as follows:
- Block C, Block D, and Block B are placed directly on the table.
- Block A is stacked on top of Block C.

The current state of the blocks regarding clearance is:
- Blocks D, B, and A are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of these blocks.

Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any of the blocks. This setup allows for actions such as moving clear blocks or picking them up since the robot hand is free.
Goal State:

VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block A is already clear and can be moved directly, which is advantageous. Block D is also clear and on the table, ready to receive block A. However, the configuration that needs to be achieved requires Block C on top of Block A, which is currently underneath Block A. The robot will need to unstack Block A from Block C, and later stack Block C on Block A after placing A on D. The sequence of moves can be logically planned given the current state, where the necessary blocks are clear, and the robot hand is empty, allowing for immediate action.
