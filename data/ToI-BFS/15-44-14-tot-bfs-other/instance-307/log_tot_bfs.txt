[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- unstack(a:default,c:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
The environment consists of four objects: blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Currently, the block 'c' is clear with nothing on it and is placed on top of block 'd'. Block 'd' is also on top of block 'b'. Block 'a' is being held by the robot hand. Block 'b' is directly on the table. This setup outlines the current configuration and status of each block in the environment.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the goal state, the desired arrangement is for block C to be on top of block B, and block D to be on top of block C. In the current state, block C is correctly positioned on top of block D, but it should be on B according to the goal. Block D should be on C, but currently, it is underneath C. Block A is currently held by the robot, which allows flexibility in repositioning without needing to unstack first.

Given that block A can be put down and blocks C and D can be rearranged directly without intervening steps (once block B is cleared if necessary), the current state seems reasonably close to the initial setup needed to achieve the goal state. The main tasks would be to reposition block D and ensure block C ends up on block B.

VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block d is on block b, and block c is on block d. Both blocks a and b are directly on the table. The robot hand is empty at the moment. Blocks a and c are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has block C on top of block D, which is on top of block B. The goal state requires block C to be on top of block B directly, with block D on top of block C. The sequence needed could involve unstacking block C from block D, followed by re-stacking after possible rearrangements of block D. Since block A is not involved in the stacking order for the goal and is clear, it does not interfere with the necessary operations. The robot hand being empty is beneficial as it can immediately perform actions like unstacking. The arrangement is close to the goal, requiring only a few correct operations.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, we have four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The configuration of these blocks is as follows:

- Block A is on top of Block C.
- Block D is on top of Block B.
- Block C is on top of Block D, creating a loop with Blocks C, D, and A.
- Block B is directly on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.
- Block A is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of Block A.

This setup describes a somewhat unusual or potentially invalid situation where Blocks C and D are both supporting and being supported by each other, which needs further clarification or adjustment in a typical Blocks world scenario.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state describes a loop configuration which is usually considered invalid in a typical Blocksworld environment since each block can either be supporting or being supported, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, assuming the description is a misinterpretation or error in visualization, the focus should be on arranging the blocks per the goal state requirements. The goal is to have C on B and D on C. Currently, Block B is already on the table, which is a good starting point since Block C needs to be placed on it. Block D should end up on top of Block C, but currently, it's part of a loop. The robot hand being empty is beneficial for rearranging the blocks. The path to the goal will involve breaking the loop correctly (likely starting with unstacking D from B and then proceeding with other moves to align them as required by the goal state).

In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Here is the configuration and status of these blocks and the robot's hand:

1. Block A is placed on the table and has no other blocks on top of it, making it clear.
2. Block B is also on the table, but it supports Block D on top of it.
3. Block C is currently being held by the robot's hand.
4. Block D is on top of Block B and is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of it.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state is somewhat close to the goal state. Block C is already in the robot's hand, which is beneficial because the goal state requires C to be placed on top of B. Since Block B is currently supporting D, D will need to be moved before C can be placed on B. The robot can place C on the table, unstack D from B, and then stack C on B, followed by stacking D on C. This sequence of actions seems feasible given the current state.

Think: The current state involves block 'a' being held by the robot hand, while block 'c' is on block 'd', which in turn is on block 'b'. The goal is to have block 'c' on block 'b', and block 'd' on block 'c'. The robot can start by putting down block 'a' on the table, which will free the hand to manipulate other blocks. Next, the robot needs to unstack block 'c' from block 'd' and then place block 'd' on the table or hold it. After this, the robot can stack block 'c' directly onto block 'b'. Lastly, block 'd' can be stacked on top of block 'c'. This sequence of actions is quite straightforward and feasible given the current state.

The valid actions are to put down block C or to stack it on blocks A or D. However, stacking C directly on D does not contribute to the goal because we need C on B.

Think: To reach the goal state where block C is on top of block B and block D is on top of block C, we need to consider the current state where block C is in the robot's hand and block D is on top of block B. The most strategic steps involve using block C first since it's already in the robot's hand. The final goal configuration necessitates placing block C directly on block B. However, block B is currently occupied by block D, so our immediate action should focus on freeing up block B. Given the valid actions, we can start by putting down block C, which will free up the robot's hand for subsequent moves.

--------------------

Think: The goal is to have block C on top of block B, and block D on top of block C. Given that block C is already in the robot's hand, the most efficient next step is to stack it on top of block B. However, since block B currently supports block D, we must first relocate block D to make block B clear. The current valid actions suggest that the robot can either put down block C or stack it on top of block A or D. To progress towards the goal, the best approach is to put down block C and then unstack block D from block B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: According to the current state, Block C is in the robot's hand and needs to be positioned on top of Block B to progress towards the goal state. However, Block B currently supports Block D, which prevents direct stacking of C on B. A logical step would be to first free up Block B by relocating Block D. The valid action 'stack(c:default,d:default)' can be used to stack C on D, which is a clear block. This action moves C from the hand and positions it in the stack, allowing future rearrangement once D is unstacked or another action is performed that could free up B.

The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block C is already on block D, which is not the desired configuration according to the goal. The goal state requires block C to be on block B with block D on top of block C. Therefore, adjustments are needed: block D must be moved off of block C, potentially placed temporarily on the table or another block, and then block C needs to be placed on block B. Finally, block D should be stacked on block C. The robot hand being empty is advantageous as it allows for immediate action, either picking up or unstacking. The current arrangement of blocks does not preclude reaching the goal state, as the necessary blocks (C and D) are clear and manipulable.

- Blocks C, B, and A are all directly on the table.
- Blocks A, C, and D are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state with block D already atop block B is somewhat close to the goal state, but requires rearrangement since the goal is to have block C atop block B and then block D atop block C. The robot can utilize the actions to rearrange the blocks. Since block D is already clear and the robot's hand is empty, the robot can start by moving block D from block B to the table or another clear block, then proceed to stack block C on block B, and finally, stack block D on block C. This sequence of actions is direct and achievable given the current state and the robot's capabilities.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state where block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C, the order of actions needs to strategically manipulate the blocks. Initially, block D is on top of B, so it must be moved before C can be placed on B. The robot hand is empty, allowing for the direct handling of blocks.

1. The first action should be to unstack block D from block B. This makes block B clear, allowing block C to be placed on it later.
2. After unstacking D and holding it, the robot can either place D down temporarily or move directly to manipulate block C. However, placing D back on the table (put-down) is necessary to free the robot hand for picking up C. This sets up for the subsequent action of stacking C on B.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block B and block D on top of block C, the first step is to clear block B by unstacking block D off it. Next, we need block C to be in a state where it can be stacked on block B. Currently, the robot hand is empty, and the valid actions allow the robot to unstack D from B or pick up blocks A or C. Since picking up block C now will not directly help in achieving the goal due to other dependencies, the best action is to unstack D from B first, making B ready to have C stacked onto it.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows the robot hand holding block D, which is a crucial step towards achieving the goal state where block D must be placed on top of block C. However, blocks B and C need to be arranged with C on top of B before D can be placed on top of C. The robot can directly stack D on C, but this would complicate reaching the final goal since B must be under C. Therefore, the next best action would be to put down D temporarily, arrange B and C, and then proceed with stacking D on C.

Think: In order to progress towards the goal state where block D needs to be on top of block C, which in turn needs to be on top of block B, a strategic approach would be to first place block D on block C. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D and block C is clear and on the table, making it possible to directly stack block D on block C. This action aligns with one part of the goal state. The second action should prepare for or move towards the rest of the goal configuration. Since block C will have block D on it after the first action, block B will need to be prepared to have block C placed on it. However, since repositioning of block C is not immediately necessary and other blocks are already clear, maintaining the current state of other blocks or preparing them for future moves could be considered in subsequent steps.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block B, and block D on top of block C, the following steps would be necessary from the current state:
1. Unstack block D from block C (since block D is currently on C and needs to be moved to allow C to be moved or to be placed on B).
2. Move block C onto block B (block B is clear and on the table, ready to have C placed on it).
3. Stack block D back on top of block C (once C is on B).

From the current configuration, these steps are straightforward and do not require any complex rearrangement of other blocks, as block B and A are already clear. The robot hand being empty is also conducive as it is ready to perform the necessary pick-up and stack actions. Thus, the current state appears to be on a direct path to achieving the goal state.

Think: In the current state, all blocks (A, B, C, D) are on the table and clear, and the robot hand is empty. To reach the goal state where block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C, the sequence of actions would typically involve picking up block C, stacking it on block B, then picking up block D and stacking it on block C. Since all blocks are clear and the hand is empty, this setup is conducive to executing these actions directly. The current state seems to be a straightforward starting point for achieving the described goal state.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

Number of Actions: 2
Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here's the current configuration:
- Block C is on the table.
- Block D is stacked on top of Block C.
- Block B is on the table and it is clear, meaning nothing is stacked on it.
- Block A is also on the table and clear.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

Each block (A, B, C, D) is positioned such that some are stacked while others are directly on the table, and no additional blocks are stacked on top of the clear blocks or the block held by the hand.
Valid Actions:
- pick-up(a:default)
- pick-up(b:default)
- unstack(d:default,c:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal state requires block C to be on top of block B, and block D on top of block C. Currently, block D is stacked on block C, which is correct for the final configuration, but block C needs to be on top of block B. To enable this, block D must be moved temporarily so that block C can be placed on block B. Therefore, the first action should be to unstack block D from block C. Once block D is in the robot hand, it will then be possible to move block C to its goal position on block B in a subsequent sequence of actions.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block B and block D is on top of C, we need to rearrange the blocks accordingly. Currently, block D is on top of block C, and block B is clear on the table. The robot hand is empty, so we can use it to manipulate the blocks. Since block D is already correctly positioned above block C, we should first unstack D from C to make C accessible. After that, we can pick up block C to eventually stack it on block B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To move towards the goal state where block C is on top of block B and block D is on top of block C, the first step should involve clearing block D from the top of block C. Therefore, using the valid action 'unstack(d:default,c:default)' is necessary. Following this, to prepare for stacking C on B, picking up block C is needed, but since it's not a valid action in the current state due to block D being on top of it, the robot hand should pick up block B or A. Picking up block B directly aligns with the goal, allowing for a subsequent action in future to stack C on B.

Current State:
In the current environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and the following conditions apply:

- Block C is on the table and no other block is on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also on the table and clear, with no other block on top of it.
- Block A is on the table and clear, similarly with no block on top.
- The robot hand is currently holding Block D.

These conditions set the stage for potential actions such as putting down Block D or stacking it on any of the clear blocks A, B, or C.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding Block D, which is a critical step towards achieving the goal state where Block D needs to be on top of Block C. Since Block C is already clear and on the table, the next logical action could be to stack Block D on Block C. This would align well with the goal state requirements. Following this, the next step would be to place Block C on Block B, which is also clear and ready to support Block C. The current state seems to be well-positioned to transition smoothly towards the goal state with a few strategic moves.

In the current scenario within the Blocksworld environment:

- The robot hand is holding block B.
- Blocks C and A are positioned on the table.
- Block D is positioned on top of block C.
- Both blocks A and D are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them.

The objects involved in this setup are blocks A, B, C, and D.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot is holding block B, and blocks C and A are on the table with block D clear on top of block C. To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block B and block D on top of block C, the robot should first put down block B on the table. Then, it should unstack block D from block C, and subsequently, stack block C on block B, and finally stack block D on block C. The current state already has block D positioned correctly relative to block C, and the robot is holding block B, which is a direct step towards stacking it under block C. This current configuration is conducive to achieving the goal state with a few strategic moves.

- Block b is also on the table and is clear, similarly having no blocks atop it.
- Block c is currently being held by the robot's hand.
- Block d is on the table and is clear.

Each block is either positioned on the table or in the case of block c, it is in the robot hand. Additionally, blocks a, b, and d are clear and free from any blocks on top, allowing them to be accessed or moved by the robot if necessary.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block c is already in the robot's hand, which is an advantageous position since the goal state requires block c to be stacked onto another block. Block b and block d are both on the table and clear, which means they can be interacted with directly. To reach the goal state, the robot can perform the following actions: put down block c onto block b (using the 'stack' action), then pick up block d and stack it on top of block c. This sequence of actions is straightforward, and given the current clear and accessible conditions of the blocks, the current state seems to be directly on the path to achieving the goal state.

In the described Blocksworld environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. Blocks C, A, and D are placed on the table. Additionally, blocks C, A, and D are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is holding block B, which is crucial as the next steps involve placing block B under block C. Since block C is clear and on the table, the robot can directly stack B onto C once B is placed down. Block D being clear and on the table also aligns well with the goal of stacking it on top of C afterwards. Thus, the current state provides a straightforward path to achieve the goal state with a few moves.

Think: According to the goal state, block C needs to be stacked on block B, and then block D needs to be stacked on block C. Currently, block C is in the robot's hand, so the first logical step is to use the action to stack block C on block B. After this, block D must be picked up and stacked on block C. However, the current valid actions do not include picking up block D. Therefore, the first step should be to stack block C on block B.

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. The configuration of these blocks and the state of the robot hand are as follows:

- Block D is on top of Block A and it is also clear.
- Block B is clear and on the table.
- Block A is on the table.
- The robot hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any block.

This setup forms the initial state of the environment, where some blocks are stacked while others are directly on the table, ready for manipulation according to the specified actions.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block C is already clear and on the table, which is a good starting point, as it needs to be placed on top of Block B to achieve the goal state. Block B is also clear and on the table, making it easy to stack Block C on top of it. However, Block D is currently on top of Block A, which complicates the situation slightly because it must be moved off of A before it can be placed on top of Block C. The robot hand being empty is beneficial as it is ready to perform actions like unstacking and stacking. Overall, the current state is not too far from the goal state, and the necessary actions (like unstacking D from A, then stacking C on B, followed by stacking D on C) are straightforward given the current block availability and the state of the robot hand.

Think: In the current state, the robot hand is empty, which allows for direct manipulation of the blocks. Block D is already above Block B, although not directly on it, and both blocks are clear. The desired goal is to have Block C on top of Block B and then Block D on top of Block C, creating a stack of B-C-D. Since Block C is already on the table and clear, the robot can easily pick up Block D, place it temporarily elsewhere (such as back on the table), and then stack Block C on Block B followed by stacking Block D on Block C. The configuration is close to the desired goal with clear and direct actions available to reach the goal state.

Think: Since the goal state is to have Block C on top of Block B, and Block D on top of Block C, and considering the current configuration where Block C is already correctly on top of Block B, it is logical to address Block D next. The valid action to move towards placing Block D on top of Block C (given that the robot's hand is empty) involves first picking up Block D. Once Block D is in the robot's hand, stacking it on Block C would be the next step. However, the action to stack Block D on Block C is not listed as a valid action currently, which might imply that another action must be taken first, or I need to refresh valid actions after picking up Block D.

- Block 'a' is currently being held by the robot hand.
- Block 'b' is also on the table.
- Block 'd' is positioned on top of block 'b' and is clear.

This setup highlights that the robot is actively engaged with block 'a', and there is a stack consisting of block 'd' over block 'b', with both blocks 'c' and 'b' directly on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 1

Think: From the current state, the robot is holding block 'a' which is not immediately relevant to achieving the stack of 'B', 'C', 'D' as described in the goal state. However, blocks 'B' and 'D' are already correctly positioned with 'D' on top of 'B'. To reach the goal state, the robot needs to put down block 'A', unstack 'D' from 'B', and stack 'C' on 'B'. Then, 'D' can be stacked on 'C'. The current state is not directly aligned with the goal state, but the robot's actions can be sequenced to reach the goal, especially since the robot is already engaging with one of the blocks and the blocks 'B' and 'D' are already in a partial correct order.

Think: The current state shows that block c is in the robot's hand, which is a positive step towards achieving the goal state where block c needs to be stacked on block b. Since blocks b and d are on the table and clear, the robot has the opportunity to stack block c on block b without any additional steps of clearing other blocks. After this, the robot can then pick up block d and stack it on block c, achieving the goal state.

- put-down(d:default)
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: The goal is to have block D on top of block C, which is already on top of block B. Given that the robot hand is currently holding block D and block C is clear, the direct action to progress towards the goal state is to stack block D on block C. This action aligns perfectly with the goal state's requirement. After placing block D, there are no other actions required to meet the goal alignment of blocks B, C, and D. However, since two actions are requested, the next logical step after stacking D on C isn't explicitly needed towards the goal but could involve a redundant action with block A, which remains unaffected by the goal state.

Actions: stack(d:default,c:default), put-down(d:default)

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(c:default,a:default)
- stack(c:default,d:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the current configuration of these objects:

- Block A is on the table and nothing is on top of it, making it clear.
- Block B is also on the table, and Block C is placed on top of Block B.
- Block C, which is on Block B, supports Block D on top of it.
- Block D, being on top of Block C, is clear with no other blocks above it.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that the blocks are stacked with C and D forming a column on top of B, while A is separate and directly on the table. The robot hand is available to manipulate any of the clear blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The goal state describes a configuration where Block C is on top of Block B, and Block D is on top of Block C. The current state already meets these conditions with Block B on the table, Block C directly on top of Block B, and Block D on top of Block C. The additional details in the current state, such as Block A being clear on the table and the robot's hand being empty, do not affect the achievement of the goal related to the configuration of Blocks B, C, and D. Therefore, the current state is already aligned with the goal state requirements.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment of the Blocksworld, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, as well as a table and a robot hand. Here's the detailed configuration:

1. Block C is on top of Block B and Block C is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it.
2. Block D is on the table and is also clear.
3. Block B is on the table.
4. Block A is on the table and is clear.
5. The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that while Blocks B, D, and A are directly on the table, only Blocks A, C, and D are clear and free of other blocks resting on top of them. The robot hand being empty suggests that it's ready to perform an action, like picking up a block or stacking one block on another.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state already has Block C on top of Block B, which is part of the goal state. The robot's hand is empty, ready to perform an action. The next step towards the goal would be to stack Block D on top of Block C. Since Block D is clear and on the table, and the robot hand is empty, this action is feasible. Therefore, the current state is conducive to reaching the goal with a series of straightforward actions.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a robot hand. Currently, block C is placed on block A, while blocks B and D are directly on the table. All the blocks (A, B, C, and D) are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state has block C on block A and blocks B and D directly on the table. To achieve the goal of having block D on top of block C and block C on top of block B, the robot will need to perform several actions: 
1. unstack block C from block A and put it down on the table, 
2. pick up block C and stack it on block B, 
3. pick up block D and stack it on block C. 
The robot hand being empty is favorable as it can immediately start executing these actions. While there are several steps involved, the fact that all blocks are clear means there are no immediate obstructions to beginning this sequence of moves.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, we have four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, block C is clear and positioned on top of block D, which is on the table. Block B and block A are also clear and directly on the table. The robot's hand is empty, indicating it's not currently holding any blocks. This setup suggests that the blocks are partially stacked with block C on block D, while blocks A and B are placed separately and directly on the table, all in a state ready for manipulation.
Goal State:
The goal in this blocks world scenario is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block B, and block D is on top of block C.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state has block C positioned on top of block D, which is correct according to the goal state where block D should be at the bottom. However, the goal requires block C to be on block B and then block D on top of block C. Currently, block B is on the table and not involved in the stack with blocks C and D. Given that the robot hand is empty, the required actions to achieve the goal state would start by unstacking block C from block D, then stacking block C on block B, and finally stacking block D on block C. Since the current state has blocks in a configuration that, with a few correct moves, can lead to the goal state, it is on a viable path towards rearranging the blocks as required.
