Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block B, and block C is on top of block A, which is on the table. The goal is to have block A on block B, and block C on block A. Since block B is already in the robot's hand, the next logical step would be to put down block B on the table, then unstack block C from A, pick up block A, and stack it on block B, followed by stacking block C on block A. This sequence of actions suggests that the current state, with block B already in hand, is conducive to reaching the goal state efficiently.

Think: The current state has block C clear and on the bottom with block B on top of it, and block A is on the table. The goal state requires block A to be on top of block B, and block C on top of block A. To achieve this, block B needs to be separated from block C, and block A must be stacked on block B. Finally, block C needs to be positioned on top of block A. Given the robot hand is empty, the necessary actions (unstacking B from C, stacking A on B, and stacking C on A) can be performed directly within the domain's action set. The current configuration does not impede the required block movements to reach the goal state.

Think: The current state where the robot is holding block C and blocks A and B are clear on the table suggests a promising start towards reaching the goal state. The goal requires stacking block A on block B and then stacking block C on block A. Since block C is already in the robot's hand, the next logical steps involve putting down block C if needed or directly stacking it on block A once block A is placed on block B. The fact that blocks A and B are clear and ready to be manipulated is advantageous. The robot can pick up block A to stack it on block B, and then proceed to stack block C on block A, moving towards the goal configuration.

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- pick-up(b:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the environment, there are three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The current configuration is such that blocks 'c' and 'b' are on the table and nothing is stacked on them, making them clear. The robot hand is currently holding block 'a'. This setup is part of a scenario where the blocks can be manipulated by the robot to achieve different configurations on the table.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved by utilizing the robot's ability to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks as required.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has the robot hand holding block 'a', and blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear on the table. The goal is to have 'a' on 'b' and 'c' on 'a'. From the current state, the robot can directly stack 'a' onto 'b', as both are accessible and 'b' is clear. Subsequently, the robot can pick up 'c' and stack it onto 'a'. These actions are straightforward and follow directly from the current setup without any need for intermediate reconfigurations that would deviate from the path to the goal state.

Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have three blocks labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The current state includes the following details:
- Block 'b' is positioned on the table.
- Block 'a' is located on top of block 'b'.
- The robot hand is currently holding block 'c'.
- Block 'a' is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.

This setup forms a part of a scenario where the goal might involve reconfiguring these blocks into a different layout using a series of actions that manipulate the blocks and the robot hand.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved by utilizing the robot's ability to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks as required.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state is already halfway to the goal state, with block 'a' positioned directly on top of block 'b', matching part of the goal configuration. The robot hand is holding block 'c', which is advantageous as the next step to reach the goal state would be to stack 'c' on top of 'a'. Given that the blocks 'a' and 'b' are already in the desired configuration and the robot hand is in position with block 'c', the current state seems to be on a clear path toward achieving the goal state.
Rating: sure

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are three blocks named A, B, and C. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. Both blocks A and C are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them, and they are located on the table. The setup is prepared for actions such as moving block B or manipulating blocks A and C since they are accessible and clear.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved by utilizing the robot's ability to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks as required.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state with the robot hand holding block B and blocks A and C clear on the table aligns well with the necessary actions to reach the goal state. The goal requires stacking block A on block B, followed by stacking block C on block A. Since block B is already in the robot's hand, the next logical step would be to put down B and then pick up A to stack it on B, then pick up C to stack on A. The current state allows for these actions to be executed in a straightforward manner, progressing towards the intended configuration.

Rating: sure

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- stack(a:default,c:default)


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 PROMPT
--------------------

[Skip LLM] The number of valid actions is less than the number of actions requested.

Actions:
- put-down(c:default)
- stack(c:default,a:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the current environment, we have three blocks named A, B, and C. Block A is positioned on top of Block C, and both Blocks B and C are directly on the table. Blocks A and B are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty, indicating it is not currently holding any blocks.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved by utilizing the robot's ability to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks as required.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks B and C on the table, with block A on top of block C. The goal state requires block C to be at the bottom, with block A on top of block B, and then block C on top of block A. To achieve the goal state from the current state, the robot would need to remove block A from block C, place it on the table or on block B, and then move block C to be on top of block A. This sequence of moves is feasible with the given operations of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks. While the current state does not directly resemble the goal state, the necessary actions to rearrange the blocks are possible and logical given the capabilities of the robot.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In the Blocksworld environment, there are three blocks named A, B, and C. Currently, block A is on top of block B, and both blocks B and C are on the table. Block C and block A are clear, meaning there is nothing on top of them. Additionally, the robot's hand is empty.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved by utilizing the robot's ability to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks as required.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state shows block A on top of block B, both of which are on the table, and block C is clear on the table. The goal state requires block C to be on top of block A, which is on top of block B. To achieve this, one viable sequence would involve unstacking block A from block B, then picking up block C, and stacking it on block A once block A is clear. This suggests that the current configuration is somewhat close to the goal since block A and B are already aligned as they need to be in the final configuration, and the robot's hand is available to perform operations.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, we have three blocks named A, B, and C, along with a table. Here's the current state of these objects:

- Block C is clear and positioned on top of Block A.
- Block A is located directly on top of Block B.
- Block B is sitting on the table.
- The robot's hand is currently empty.

This setup provides a clear visual of the vertical stack from the table up, with Block B at the base, Block A in the middle, and Block C at the top, with no other blocks interfering on top of Block C. The robot is ready to manipulate these blocks as its hand is empty.
Goal State:
The goal in this environment is to rearrange the blocks such that block 'a' is directly on top of block 'b', and block 'c' is directly on top of block 'a'. This configuration needs to be achieved by utilizing the robot's ability to pick up, put down, stack, and unstack the blocks as required.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: The current state of the blocks is already aligned with the goal state except for the letter case difference in the block names, which might be a typographical error rather than a different state. If we assume 'Block A' is 'block a', 'Block B' is 'block b', and 'Block C' is 'block c', then the setup is exactly as required by the goal state. The robot's hand being empty is also suitable as it does not interfere with the achievement of the goal state but rather shows readiness for any required action.
