Actions:
- unstack(c:default,d:default)


VALUE PROMPT 1
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as a, b, c, and d. Currently, the robot hand is holding block c. Block d is positioned on top of block a, which in turn is on top of block b. Block b is directly on the table. Additionally, block d is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of it. This setup represents the state of the blocks and the robot hand's interaction with them in the given scenario.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this specific setup is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is already holding block C, which is a beneficial position since the goal state requires block C to be eventually placed on top of block D. Block D is clear and on top of block A, which is on top of block B. For block C to be placed on block D as required in the goal, block D needs to be moved off of block A and placed on block B. The fact that block D is already clear and block C is in the robot's hand indicates that the current state is somewhat aligned with the steps needed to achieve the goal state. However, repositioning of block D is necessary, which involves additional steps.

VALUE PROMPT 1

Current State:
In the current environment, there are four blocks labeled A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Here is the configuration and status of each item:

- Block C is clear and on the table.
- Block D is clear and placed on top of Block A.
- Block B is on the table.
- Block A is on top of Block B and under Block D.
- The robot's hand is empty.

This setup forms a stack where Blocks A and D are involved in vertical arrangements with other blocks, while Blocks B and C are directly on the table. The robot hand is not currently holding any of the blocks.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: To reach the goal state from the current state, the robot must rearrange blocks to achieve the specified stacking order of C on D on B. Currently, Blocks C and B are clear and on the table, which is advantageous as B can directly serve as the base of the new stack. Block D is on A, so it needs to be unstacked from A and then stacked on B. Finally, Block C, which is already clear and on the table, can be directly stacked on D. The current setup provides a clear path towards rearranging the blocks as required by the goal, with several steps needed but no major obstacles.

VALUE PROMPT 2
--------------------

Current State:
In this Blocksworld setup, there are four blocks labeled a, b, c, and d, as well as a robot hand. The arrangement of blocks is as follows:
- Block c is clear and placed directly on block d.
- Block d is positioned on top of block a.
- Block a is stacked on block b.
- Block b is resting on the table.
Additionally, the robot's hand is currently empty. This setup requires manipulation of these blocks to achieve a specific configuration, likely involving the actions of picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking blocks.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has block c on top of block d, and block d on top of block a, which is on top of block b. The goal state requires block c on top of block d, and block d on top of block b, without block a in between. The robot's hand is empty, which is suitable for beginning the reconfiguration process. To achieve the goal, the robot needs to unstack block d from block a and then restack it on block b, after ensuring block b is clear by moving block a. Since these steps are straightforward and follow the typical actions allowed in Blocksworld (unstacking and stacking), the current state appears to be on a direct path to achieving the goal.

VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding Block D, which is a critical step towards achieving the goal state because Block D needs to be stacked. Since Block B is already on the table and clear (with Block A on top of it), Block D can be stacked onto Block B directly. The subsequent action would involve moving Block A and then stacking Block C on top of Block D. Although there are several steps involved, the current state's configuration with Block D in the robot hand and Block B on the table makes it feasible to progress towards the goal state.

--------------------

Think: The current state shows that the robot hand is holding block c, and the stack from bottom to top is b-a-d. The goal state requires the configuration to be b-d-c. Since the robot hand is already holding block c, it can directly move to stack c on d after block d is rearranged properly. However, d is currently on a, which is not the desired position since it needs to be directly on b. The required actions would involve unstacking d from a and then stacking it onto b. Since these actions are feasible and align with the necessary steps to achieve the goal state, the current state appears to be on the path to reaching the goal.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal of having block C on top of block D, which is in turn on top of block B, we need to place block D in a position where block C can be stacked on it subsequently. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D. The most strategic move is to stack block D on block B since block B is on the table and clear. This aligns with the goal state where block D needs to be directly on block B. After block D is stacked, block C, which is already clear and on the table, can be stacked on block D. Hence, the sequence of actions should involve stacking D on B and then stacking C on D.

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, the current holding of block D by the robot hand can be strategically utilized. Since the robot currently holds block D, and block B is clear, the first logical action is to place block D on top of block B using the stack action.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block D, which is on top of block B, we need to first create a scenario where block D is accessible to be stacked under block C. Since the robot hand is currently holding block D, the next reasonable step is to put down block D on the table. This action will allow us to later stack block C on block D. The current valid actions include putting down block D or stacking it on top of blocks A or C. Since stacking it on C directly does not align with our goal (as block C needs to be on top of D), the best action now is to put down block D. After placing D down, the next action would be to pick up block C to prepare it for stacking on block D.

Think: To make progress towards the goal state where block C should be on top of block D, which is on top of block B, the current action should involve handling block D, as it is currently held by the robot hand. The valid actions suggest placing block D on block A or C, or putting it down on the table. Since the goal is to have block D on top of block B, the best initial move is to put block D down on the table to free the robot hand.

Think: To reach the goal state where block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, it's necessary to first place block D on block B. Currently, block D is held by the robot hand, and block B is on the table and clear. Thus, the direct action of stacking D on B is appropriate. Since stacking D on C would not help achieve the goal directly and putting down D would just extend the process unnecessarily, the only valid and useful action right now is to stack D on B. After D is on B, the next step will involve dealing with block C, which is already clear and can be directly stacked on D.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block D, which is on top of block B, we need to first place block D (which is currently held by the robot) on the table. This is necessary because we eventually want to stack block D on top of block B, and then stack block C on top of block D. The valid actions provided allow us to put down block D or stack it on top of block C or block A.

Since the robot hand is currently holding D, and B is on the table, stacking D directly on B is the best initial action. The second action should then aim to prepare for stacking C on D in subsequent moves. Thus, putting down D after stacking it on B will keep D clear and ready for the next move, although this action is not currently valid. Since our valid actions include stacking D on C or A, or putting it down anywhere, the logical step after placing D on B is to leave the hand empty by using the put-down action, preparing for the next sequence of moves in future steps.

The goal in this specific setup is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: In order to reach the goal state where Block C is on top of Block D, and Block D is on top of Block B, the robot must first release Block D. Currently, Block D is in the robot's hand and can either be put down or stacked on top of Block C or Block A. To align with the goal state, the robot should put down Block D directly on the table since stacking it on Block C or Block A doesn't directly contribute to our goal configuration of blocks. Once D is on the table, it can be stacked on Block B as specified in the goal state.

Think: The goal state requires block C to be on top of block D, and block D on top of block B. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D. A logical step would be to position block D in order to eventually place block C on top of it as per the goal. The valid actions suggest that block D can be stacked directly on block C or block A, or put down on the table. To align with the goal, placing D on B is necessary but since that action isn't directly available and D needs to be freed up first, we should put D down on the table. After this, we can reassess the next step to manipulate blocks towards the final goal configuration.

Think: To reach the goal state where block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, we need to first make sure block D is positioned correctly. Currently, the robot hand is holding block D, and the valid actions suggest that block D can be stacked on block C or block A, or put down. Since stacking D on C or A now does not help us achieve the stacking order required by the goal, the optimal immediate action is to put down block D on the table, freeing up the robot hand and preserving the position of blocks A, B, and C for optimal subsequent stacking. After putting down block D, the next action should be to pick up block D again when block B is ready to receive it, but as this exact action isn't available, we would optimally wait for such an action to become valid in subsequent steps.

To progress towards the goal, Block D should be placed on top of Block B first. The valid action to achieve this part of the goal configuration is not explicitly listed, but given the robot is holding Block D and Block B is clear and on the table, the typical action would be to stack Block D on Block B if it were a valid option. The available valid actions suggest stacking Block D on Block C or Block A, or putting Block D down on the table. To adapt to the currently valid options and consider future moves, I will select to put Block D down first, making it available for the subsequent correct stacking.

Think: To reach the goal state where block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, we need to first ensure that block D is correctly positioned. Since the robot hand is currently holding block D, the first logical step is to place block D on the table or on another block that aligns it with the target configuration. However, placing block D on block B directly is not immediately available as a valid action. The available valid actions suggest stacking block D on block C or block A, or putting block D down on the table.

Given the goal, stacking block D on block C right now wouldn't directly help achieve the goal configuration. We could consider putting block D down on the table first, which will then allow for subsequent actions to correctly position block D under block C as per the goal state. Assuming future valid actions will permit manipulating block D to be placed under block C, the initial action of putting block D on the table seems most appropriate.

In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this specific setup is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: Given the current state where block A is held by the robot and blocks B, C, and D are clear on the table, and considering the goal to stack C on D, and D on B, the first step should be to free up the robot's hand by putting down block A. This allows for future actions to manipulate blocks B, C, and D. After putting down A, the next step should be to pick up block D to prepare for stacking it on B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 1 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: From the current state, the robot hand is holding block A, which needs to be placed down to free the hand for other actions, especially since the goal involves stacking C on D and D on B. The first action should be to put down A since it is currently in the hand. Following this, the hand will be free to perform other actions like picking up block D, which is necessary for the goal to stack it on B. However, the valid actions only include stacking A on other blocks, so the next best step is to utilize the available action to stack A on one of the blocks, potentially D or B, to ensure other blocks like C can remain clear for subsequent moves.

Think: The current state presents all blocks (A, B, C, and D) placed independently on the table with the robot hand empty. This is a neutral starting position, allowing any block to be freely manipulated. The goal requires stacking C on D and D on B. The current setup does not directly align with the final goal but provides a blank slate from which to build the desired configuration. The blocks being clear and the robot hand being empty are advantageous, as it allows for immediate action towards stacking without needing to clear any blocks first. However, achieving the goal will require a series of correct manipulations, starting from a very basic setup.

In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. The current state of these objects is as follows:

- Block D is also on the table.
- Block A is placed on top of Block D and is clear.
- Block B is clear and positioned on the table.
- The robot hand is currently empty.

This setup indicates that while Blocks A, B, and C are not obstructed by any other blocks (hence "clear"), only Blocks B, C, and D are directly on the table. Block A is stacked on top of Block D. The robot's hand being empty suggests it is ready to perform an action, such as picking up a block or manipulating the current configuration.

VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state is somewhat aligned with the goal state in terms of the position of blocks B, C, and D. Block B is already on the table and clear, which is necessary as it needs to be at the base of the final stack in the goal state. Block D is on the table and can be moved onto Block B relatively easily. Block C, although clear and on the table, needs to be stacked on Block D once D is on B. The robot hand being empty is beneficial as it can immediately engage in actions such as picking up Block D or A to rearrange them as needed. The key action needed next would likely involve moving Block A from its current position atop D to achieve the specified arrangement of the blocks in the goal state.

VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, Block D is already clear and positioned above Block A, which indicates that some repositioning actions are necessary to achieve the goal state. To align with the goal, Block D first needs to be removed from atop Block A and ideally placed on the table or directly stacked onto Block B. Block C, which is clear and on the table, needs to be stacked on Block D after Block D is correctly positioned on Block B. The robot's empty hand facilitates these actions, as it can immediately engage in picking up Block D. Since the robot hand is empty, and the blocks that need to be manipulated (Block D and Block C) are clear, the current state provides a conducive setup for progressing towards the goal state. However, because Block D is initially stacked on Block A, and not directly on Block B, there's an additional step involved to reposition Block D correctly.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, we need to start stacking the blocks in the correct order. Since all blocks are currently on the table and the robot's hand is empty, the first logical step is to pick up block D so it can later be stacked on block B. The second action should involve picking up block C so that it can subsequently be placed on block D after the next actions are determined.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal of having block C on top of block D, and block D on top of block B, we need to rearrange the blocks accordingly. Currently, block A is on top of block D, which needs to be moved to access block D. The first action should involve freeing block D by unstacking block A from it. After block A is unstacked and the robot's hand is occupied, the next logical step in the context of available actions is to pick up another block that will be part of the final configuration, such as block B or C. Since block B needs to be at the bottom of the stack in the goal state, picking up block C seems more aligned with subsequent actions like stacking it later.

A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this specific setup is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 1
--------------------

Think: The current state has blocks A, B, C, and D all clear and separated on the table, with block A being held by the robot hand. The goal is to have C on D, and D on B, with block B on the table. From the current state, the robot would need to put down block A (since it's currently being held). Then, the robot can proceed to stack D on B, and subsequently stack C on D. Given that all blocks are clear and the robot hand will be free once it puts down A, the actions needed to reach the goal state are straightforward and involve direct stacking.

Think: In the current state, the robot is holding block B, and blocks C, A, and D are on the table and clear. According to the goal state, the desired configuration is for block C to be on top of block D, and block D on top of block B. Since the robot is already holding block B, the next logical steps would likely involve placing block B down on the table, then stacking block D on top of B, followed by stacking block C on top of D. The robot's current state of holding block B is an advantageous position for beginning to achieve the goal state configuration, as it can directly influence the placement of block B, which is foundational for the desired stack.

The next logical steps could involve placing block B down and then stacking D on B and C on D in sequence.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE
--------------------

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, we need to consider the best way to use the robot's current situation of holding block B. The most direct approach given that block B is already in hand and other key blocks (C and D) are clear, is to first place block B down in a position where it can later support block D. Therefore, putting block B directly on the table will maintain its clear status and make it ready to support block D in a future action. After putting down B, the next step should be to stack block D on top of block B.

ACTIONS PROPOSAL 2 RESPONSE

Think: To progress towards the goal state where block C is on top of block D, which is on top of block B, I need to first make sure block B is on the table or on another block to later place D on top of B. Currently, the robot hand is holding block B. The valid action of stacking block B on block D should be taken first. This will place B on D, partially setting up the desired configuration. After B is stacked on D, block C (which is clear and on the table) needs to be manipulated. Since the robot's hand will be empty after the first stacking, the next step would involve picking up block C in preparation for stacking it in subsequent actions.

Think: Given that the robot is currently holding block B, we need to consider actions that utilize block B effectively to progress towards the goal state. The goal is to have block C on top of block D, and block D on top of block B. Since block B is in hand, it can be used as a base. Placing block B down first doesn't align with the goal configuration directly, so it's more strategic to stack block B on one of the blocks that will form the base of the final stack. Stacking B on D is a reasonable move, as it sets up for D to be at the bottom of the desired stack (C on D on B).

Think: The current state shows Block C and D clear and on the table, with Block A on top of Block B. To achieve the goal state where Block C is on top of Block D, and Block D is on top of Block B, a series of actions need to be planned. First, Block A must be moved from the top of Block B to allow Block D to be stacked onto Block B. Block A can be picked up and placed back on the table, then Block D can be picked up and stacked on Block B, followed by picking up Block C and stacking it on Block D. Since the required blocks are clear and the robot's hand is empty, this is a feasible sequence of actions that can logically lead to the goal state.

However, block A will need to be moved first since it is currently on top of block B. After moving block A, block D can be stacked onto block B, and then block C can be placed on top of block D. The actions required are within the capabilities provided by the environment (pick-up, put-down, stack, unstack), and the current configuration doesn't include any contradictory or problematic placements that would prevent reaching the goal from the current state.

In the environment, there are four blocks named A, B, C, and D, along with a table and a robot hand. Currently, block A and block C are on the table and are clear, with nothing on top of them. Block B is placed on block C and is also clear. Block D is on the table and clear. The robot's hand is empty at this moment.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this specific setup is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.

Think: In the current state, blocks A and C are on the table and clear, B is on C and clear, and D is also on the table and clear. The robot's hand is empty. To reach the goal state where C is on D and D is on B, several actions need to be taken. First, block B must be made clear by unstacking block B from C. Then, block D should be picked up and placed on block B. Finally, block C should be picked up and stacked on block D. The current state is conducive to these actions because the necessary blocks are already clear or can be easily made clear, and the robot's hand is empty, ready to perform operations.

Think: In the current state, blocks C and D are both clear and on the table, with B stacked on A. The goal state requires C on D and D on B. To achieve this, D must first be moved to a position where it can have B placed under it. B needs to be unstacked from A and then restacked under D, followed by placing C on top of D. Given the robot hand is empty, it is poised to begin these operations. The fact that blocks C and D are clear is beneficial as it simplifies the number of moves needed to start manipulating them per the goal requirements.

Think: To achieve the goal state where block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B, the current state needs to transition by placing blocks in a specific order. Currently, block B is being held by the robot, which is a promising start since block B needs to be at the bottom of the stack in the goal state. The robot can put block B down, either on the table temporarily or ideally directly onto block D if block D is picked up next. Since all other blocks (C, A, D) are clear and on the table, they are easily accessible for manipulation, which is essential for building the required stack.

To reach the goal state, where block 'c' is on top of 'd' and block 'd' on top of 'b', the following actions are needed: the robot needs to put down block 'd' either on the table or stack it on block 'b', then 'c' must be unstacked from 'b', and finally, 'c' must be stacked on 'd'. Since the robot's hand is currently holding 'd', it is feasible to move towards the goal state by properly arranging these blocks as per the goal condition.

Therefore, I need to reposition block D first to free up block B for rearrangement. I can stack D on A, as A is also clear and this action will keep D accessible while allowing future moves to unstack B from C.

Think: In the current state, Block D is already on top of Block B, which is part of the goal state configuration. However, Block C needs to be moved from its current position on the table to the top of Block D. This requires the robot to perform a sequence of actions that include unstacking Block D from Block B, moving Block C, and then restacking Block D on top of Block B in the correct order.

1. Block c is placed directly on the table.
2. Block a is currently being held by the robot hand.
3. Block d is positioned on top of block b.
4. Block b is stacked on top of block c.
5. Block d is clear, meaning there is no block on top of it.

This setup forms a vertical stack with block c at the base on the table, followed by block b above c, and block d at the top of the stack above block b. Meanwhile, block a is not part of this stack as it is in the grip of the robot hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this specific setup is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 2
--------------------

Think: The current state has block c on the table with block b on top of c, and block d on top of b. Block a is in the robot's hand. The goal state requires block c to be on top of block d, which is then on top of block b. The current stack order of b-c and d-b is incorrect for the goal. To achieve the goal, block d needs to be repositioned beneath block c, which is a significant rearrangement. This rearrangement will involve multiple steps: putting down block a, unstacking block d from b, and then rearranging the blocks to achieve the correct order.

Rating: maybe

The current setup is not straightforward for achieving the goal due to the required reordering of blocks, but it is not impossible as the blocks are mostly accessible and can be rearranged with a series of correct actions. Hence, the current state could be on the path to the goal state, depending on the subsequent actions taken.

VALUE PROMPT 3
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D, and a table. Currently, block D is on block A, and block B is on block D. Block A is on the table. The robot hand is holding block C, and block B is clear, meaning there is nothing on top of block B.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 3
--------------------

Think: In the current state, block C is already being held by the robot hand, which is a crucial step towards achieving the goal state where C needs to be stacked on D. However, block D currently has block B on top of it, which means block B needs to be moved before block C can be stacked on block D. In the goal state, block D needs to be on top of block B. Thus, rearranging block B and then stacking C on D would progress towards the goal state. The robot hand's current occupation (holding C) is directly useful for one of the next necessary actions once block B is correctly positioned.

Rating: maybe

VALUE PROMPT 4
--------------------

Current State:
In the described environment, there are four blocks labeled as A, B, C, and D along with a table and a robot hand. The current configuration of the blocks and the status of the robot hand is as follows:

1. Block B is currently being held by the robot hand.
2. Block C is clear, meaning there is no other block on top of it, and it is on the table.
3. Block A is also on the table.
4. Block D is on top of Block A and is clear, indicating that there is no block on top of Block D. 

This setup encompasses the specific positioning and states of each block along with the status of the robot's hand.
Goal State:
In this Blocksworld scenario, the environment consists of a set of blocks, a table, and a robot hand. The blocks can be placed either on top of other blocks or directly on the table. A block is considered clear if there is nothing on top of it, and the robot hand can either hold a block or be empty.

The goal in this specific setup is to arrange the blocks such that block C is on top of block D, and block D is on top of block B. This configuration requires manipulating the blocks to achieve the desired stacking order using a series of actions that might involve picking up, putting down, stacking, and unstacking the blocks.


VALUE RESPONSE 4
--------------------

Think: The current state has block B already being held by the robot hand, which is a beneficial starting point since the goal state requires block B to be at the bottom of a stack. However, block D will need to be moved from its current position on top of block A to be on top of block B, and then block C placed on top of block D. Given that block D is already clear, it can be directly stacked on block B once B is placed on the table. The subsequent action would involve picking up block C (already clear and on the table) and stacking it on block D. The sequence of actions from the current state to the goal state appears to be straightforward and feasible with a few optimal moves.
