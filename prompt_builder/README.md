# Prompt Builder

The prompt builder is a tool to help you version control your prompts. To use it, you must create a `prompt.yml` inside of the `sandbox` directory and then run `prompt_builder.py` to version control it under the `prompts` directory. For instructions on how to create a prompt, refer to the latest version of documentation under `docs` and check the `PROMPTS.md` for how to create the YAML file Some dummy templates are also available under `docs/v#/templates`
