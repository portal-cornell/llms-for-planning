  - at-robby(robot1,room2) where robot1 is a robot at room room2
  - at(ball1,room2) where ball1 is a ball at room room2
  - free(robot1,gripper2) where robot1 is a robot with a gripper gripper2 that is free (not holding a ball)
  - carry(robot1,ball2,gripper3) where robot1 is a robot carrying a ball ball2 with a grippger gripper3
