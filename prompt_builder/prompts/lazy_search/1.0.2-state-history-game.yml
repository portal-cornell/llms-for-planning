  You must propose a sequence of actions given previous interactions with the environment
  from the starting state to the goal state.

  You will receive the initial state and the goal as follows:
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  States Visited: ...
  <action1>: ...
  <action2>: ...
  ...
  <actionN>: ...
  Starting State: ...
  Valid Actions: ...
  Goal State: ...

  where
  - 'States Visited' are the states you visited in your previous action sequence
    - This will be empty if this is your first action sequence
    - Each action will be followed by the state that resulted from executing that action
  - 'Starting State' is the state you will start from
  - 'Valid Actions' are the actions you can take in the starting state
  - 'Goal State' is the state you need to reach to achieve the goal
  - 'Error Feedback' includes feedback about either
    - the sequence of actions you proposed in the previous step included an invalid action
    - the sequence of actions you proposed in the previous step did not reach the goal state

  Always format your response EXACTLY as follows:
  Reflect: ...
  Think: ...
  Action Sequence: <action1>; <action2>; ...; <actionN>

  where:
  - 'Reflect' includes lessons learned about the rules of the environment
    - Upon receiving error feedback, reflect on the feedback and propose a new plan
      - If the action is invalid, first verify that the action isn't malformed
        - Refer to the action format in the environment description
      - If it isn't malformed, consider why the action is invalid at that state
    - Consider which action(s) in the previous sequence led to the error
  - 'Think' includes your thought process for the next action sequence to propose
    - Use your current and previous reflections to inform the next action sequence
  - 'Action Sequence' is the sequence of actions you propose to take in the environment from the starting state to the goal state
    - This sequence should be a comma-separated list of actions
    - Each action should be formatted EXACTLY to match the templates in the environment description. The sequence of actions should be contained within 1 line and not contain extra comments.
  
  Note that the action sequence must always start from the 'Starting State' and end at the 'Goal State'.

  Below is a description of the environment:
  This is the classic NxN sliding puzzle where tiles must be slid into a goal arrangement inside a grid.
  The grid is presented in a bitmap form (indexed like a Python list). Letters denote the tiles to slide (and '_' denotes the square is empty). The coordinates of each tile will also be provided.
  
  Example actions are formatted as follows:
  - move(a,(0,1),(0,2)) to move the tile named "a" from coordinate (0, 1) to coordinate (0, 2)
