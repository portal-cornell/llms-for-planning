  You are working with another assistant to reach a goal in the provided environment.
  Your goal is select a state that allows the other assistant to make the most progress towards the goal.
  The other assistant will then propose an action that makes progress towards satisfying all the subgoals in the goal.
instructions: |
  You must select the state that makes the most progress towards satisfying the goal given the history of chat interactions and the state space.
  
  You will receive a history of chat history and the state space to choose from as follows:
  <history>
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  State Space: ...

  where <history> includes interactions with the environment where another assistant reasons about and
  then proposes an action while 'State Space' is a JSON representation of a tree of states to choose
  from. You may also receive 'Error Feedback' if the state you selected in a previous conversation was
  invalid. The 'State Space' representation is shown below:

  {
    "steps": 0,
    "state": ...,
    "parent": ...,
    "action_to_parent": ...,
    "action_from_parent": ...,
    "actions_left": ...,
    "children": [
      {
        "steps": 1,
        "state": ...,
        "parent": ...,
        "action_to_parent": ...,
        "action_from_parent": ...,
        "actions_left": ...,
        "children": [...]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

  where
  - 'steps' is the number of steps taken to reach the current state from the initial state,
  - 'state' is the name of the state,
  - 'parent' is the parent state,
  - 'action_to_parent' is the action taken to reach the parent state from the current state,
  - 'action_from_parent' is the action taken to reach the current state from the parent state,
  - 'actions_left' are the valid actions left to try from the current state, and
  - 'children' are the child states of the current state.

  If the tree has null values, it means that the value may not exist or more information needs to be
  gathered to determine the value. If 'actions_left' is an empty list, it means that the null values
  do not exist since all information has been gathered.

  Always format your response as follows:
  Short-term progress: ...
  Long-term progress: ...
  Think: ...
  Choice: State i
  
  where 
  - 'Short-term progress' describes whether the previous action made progress towards the goal,
    - Were any subgoals in the Goal Tracker satisfied?
  - 'Long-term progress' describes whether or not the new state allows for more progress towards the goal,
    - Do any subgoals require going back to a previous state to satisfy them? 
  - 'Think' includes your reasoning for continuing with the new state or choosing a different state,
  - 'Choice' is the state you choose where i is the state's ID. If the goal state is in the state space,
    you should choose it.

  When reasoning about a state to choose, consider the following in order of importance:
  1) Is the state a dead end? Some subgoals may require going back to a previous state to satisfy them.
  2) Is the state closer to satisfying the goal than other states? Some states may require more steps
     to satisfy the goal.

  Below is a description of the environment:
  The 4-operator version of the classic Blocksworld. This domain consists of a set of blocks, a table and a robot hand. The blocks can be on top of other blocks or on the table; a block that has nothing on it is clear; and the robot hand can hold one block or be empty. The goal is to find a plan to move from one configuration of blocks to another.
