  You are an assistant that chooses the best state with respect to a plan and a list of states.
instructions: |
  You must propose an action given a plan and the current state of the environment.
  
  The Blocksworld environment consists of blocks and a table. Blocks can either be on top 
  of other blocks or the table. There are 4 actions that can be performed in this environment:
  picking up or putting down a block, and stacking or unstacking two blocks. Blocks can be picked
  up from the table or put down on the block. Blocks can be stacked on top of other blocks or
  unstacked from other blocks.

  The actions are represented as strings in the following way:
  - pick-up(block1): pick up block1 from the table
  - put-down(block1): put down block1 on the table
  - stack(block1, block2): stack block1 on top of block2
  - unstack(block1, block2): unstack block1 from block2
examples:
- description: Beginning of plan
- observation: |
    Initial state: block1 on table, block2 on table, block3 on table
    Plan:
    1) Pick up block2 from the table
    2) Stack block2 on top of block3
    3) Pick up block1 from the table
    4) Stack block1 on top of block2
    Current state: block1 on table, block2 on table, block3 on table
- response: |
    Reasoning: The plan requires picking up block2 from the table to stack it on top of block3. The
    current state of the environment is that block2 is on the table. Therefore, the action to propose
    is to pick up block2 from the table.
    Action: pick-up(block2)
- description: Middle of plan
- observation: |
    Initial state: block1 on table, block2 on table, block3 on table
    Plan:
    1) Pick up block2 from the table
    2) Stack block2 on top of block3
    3) Pick up block1 from the table
    4) Stack block1 on top of block2
    Current state: block1 on table, block2 in hand, block3 on table
- response: |
    Reasoning: The plan requires stacking block2 on top of block3. The current state of the environment
    is that block2 is in hand. Therefore, the action to propose is to stack block2 on top of block3.
    Action: stack(block2, block3)
- description: End of plan
- observation: |
    Initial state: block1 on table, block2 on table, block3 on table
    Plan:
    1) Pick up block2 from the table
    2) Stack block2 on top of block3
    3) Pick up block1 from the table
    4) Stack block1 on top of block2
    Current state: block1 on table, block2 on block3, block3 on table
- response: |
    Reasoning: The plan requires picking up block2 from the table to stack it on top of block3. This
    has already been done. Then, the plan requires picking up block1 from the table to stack it on top
    of block2. The current state of the environment is that block1 is on the table. Therefore, the action
    to propose is to pick up block1 from the table.
    Action: pick-up(block1)
- description: Not exactly on the plan
- observation: |
    Initial state: block1 on table, block2 on table, block3 on table
    Plan:
    1) Pick up block2 from the table
    2) Stack block2 on top of block3
    3) Pick up block1 from the table
    4) Stack block1 on top of block2
    Current state: block1 on block2, block2 on table, block3 on table
- response: |
    Reasoning: The plan requires picking up block2 from the table to stack it on top of block3. The
    current state of the environment is that block1 is on block2. Therefore, the action to propose
    is to unstack block1 from block2.
    Action: unstack(block1, block2)
