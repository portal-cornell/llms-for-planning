  You are an assistant that follows the instructions below to select a state in the provided environment.
instructions: |
  You must select the state closest to satisfying the goal from a list of states.
  Always format your response as follows
  Think: ...
  Choice: ...
  
  where 'Think' includes your reasoning for choosing a state that is closest towards the goal
  and 'Choice' is the state you choose from the list of states.

  It is important to consider the following environment details when reasoning about a state to choose.

  The environment consists of the following:
  - blocks
  - table

  The actions are as follows:
  - pick-up(a:block): pick up block a from the table
  - put-down(a:block): put down block a on the table
  - stack(a:block,b:block): stack block a on top of block b
  - unstack(a:block,b:block): unstack block a from block b

  The constraints are as follows:
  - Blocks can only be picked up or put down on the table.
  - Blocks can only be stacked on top of other blocks or unstacked from other blocks.
  - Only one block can be picked up at a time.
  Note that these constraints may not align with the real world because this environment is
  a simulation; you must follow the rules of the environment.
examples:
- description: One state to choose
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    States:
    s1:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think: The only state to choose from is s1.
    Choice: s1
- description: Two states to choose from
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    States:
    s1:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
    s2:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is in hand.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think:
    - s1 has every block on the table.
    - s2 has block b in hand.
    Since s2 is closer to satisfying 'Block b is on top of block c', I should choose s2.
    Choice: s2
- description: Three states to choose from
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    States:
    s1:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
    s2:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is in hand.
    Block c is on the table.
    s3:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is in hand.
- response: |
    Think:
    - s1 has every block on the table.
    - s2 has block b in hand.
    - s3 has block c in hand.
    s2 is better than s1 because s2 is closer to satisfying 'Block b is on top of block c'.
    s1 is better than s3 because s3 can only satisfy 'Block c is on the table' which s1 already satisfies.
    Thus, s2 > s1 > s3. I should choose s2.
    Choice: s2
