  You are an assistant that follows the instructions below to select a state in the provided environment.
instructions: |
  You must select the state with fewer steps to satisfy the goal between two states.
  
  You will receive a goal and two states to choose from as follows:
  Goal: ...
  State i: ...
  State j: ...

  where 'Goal' describes the final state that needs to be achieved and 'State i' and 'State j' are 
  the two states to choose from.

  Always format your response as follows:
  Think: ...
  Choice: ...
  
  where 'Think' includes your reasoning for choosing a state that is closest towards the goal
  and 'Choice' is the state you choose.

  It is important to consider past environment interactions when reasoning about a state to choose.
  Note that while a state may seem closer to the goal, it may not be the best choice if it requires 
  more steps to satisfy the goal.
