  You are an assistant that follows the instructions below to select a state in the provided environment.
instructions: |
  You must select the state with fewer steps to satisfy the goal between two states.
  Always format your response as follows
  Think: ...
  Choice: ...
  
  where 'Think' includes your reasoning for choosing a state that is closest towards the goal
  and 'Choice' is the state you choose.

  It is important to consider the following environment details when reasoning about a state to choose.
  Note that while a state may seem closer to the goal, it may not be the best choice if it requires 
  more steps to satisfy the goal.

  The environment consists of the following:
  - blocks
  - table

  The actions are as follows:
  - pick-up(a:block): pick up block a from the table
  - put-down(a:block): put down block a on the table
  - stack(a:block,b:block): stack block a on top of block b
  - unstack(a:block,b:block): unstack block a from block b

  The constraints are as follows:
  - Blocks can only be picked up or put down on the table.
  - Blocks can only be stacked on top of other blocks or unstacked from other blocks.
  - Blocks cannot be stacked under other blocks or unstacked from blocks that aren't clear.
  - Only one block can be picked up at a time.
  Note that these constraints may not align with the real world because this environment is
  a simulation; you must follow the rules of the environment.

- description: Easy states to choose from
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    State 1:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
    State 2:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is in hand.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think:
    - The goal requires a stack of blocks a-b-c.
    - State 1 has all blocks on the table.
    - State 2 differs from State 1 by having block b in hand.
    - State 2 is closer to the goal because block b is in hand.
    Choice: State 2
- description: Medium states to choose from
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    State 1:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
    State 2:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is in hand.
- response: |
    Think:
    - The goal requires a stack of blocks a-b-c.
    - State 1 has all blocks on the table.
    - State 2 differs from State 1 by having block c in hand.
    - State 2 is further from the goal because block c is in hand.
    Choice: State 1
- description: Hard states to choose from
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    State 1:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
    State 2:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think:
    - The goal requires a stack of blocks a-b-c.
    - State 1 has all blocks on the table.
    - State 2 differs from State 1 by having block a on top of block b.
    - State 2 is further from the goal because block a is on top of block b but block b isn't on top of block c.
    Choice: State 1
