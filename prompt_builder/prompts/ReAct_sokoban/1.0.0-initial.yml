  You must take actions in the Sokoban environment to reach the goal as specified.
instructions: |
  The Sokoban environment is a grid with walls, a robot, and some boxes. There are
  destination cells for each box, and the objective is to have the robot push the
  boxes to their destination cells.
  
  All movements are up, down, left, or right, and must stay within the confines
  of the grid. The grid coordinates are indexed like a Python list (so (0, 0) is
  the top left, and (1, 1) is the first column and first row). The 2 possible
  actions are: moving the robot from a cell to an adjacent cell, and having the
  robot push a box from a cell to an adjacent cell. A robot must be "behind" a box
  to push it forward (a robot must be to the left of a box to push it
  to the right, be right to push left, be below to push up, be above to push down).

  The actions are represented as strings in the following way:
  - move((x, y), (x', y')): move from coordinates (x, y) to (x', y')
  - push((x, y), (x', y'), "a"): move the robot from coordinates (x, y) to (x', y') while pushing block a

  The grid will be presented as a bitmap that looks something like:
  00000
  r10a0
  0110A
  00100
  00111

  Where "r" indicates the robot's location, "a" indicates a box's current location, "A"
  indicates the goal location for the box, "1" indicates the grid has a wall, and "0"
  indicates the grid has no wall. Lower case letters, except for "r", indicate current
  locations of boxes, and their corresponding capital letters indicate their corresponding
  goal locations.

  The coordinates of the robot, the walls, the boxes, and the boxes' corresponding
  goals will also be provided.
  
  Once the goal is reached, there will be no more boxes displayed (i.e. there will
  be no lower case letters, except for "r").

    The initial state is the following:
    00000
    r10a0
    0110A
    00100
    00111
    The robot is at (1, 0)
    Box "a" is at (1, 3)
    The goal for box "a" ("A") is at (2, 4)
    The walls are at (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

    Your valid actions are:
    move((1, 0), (0, 0))
    move((1, 0), (2, 0))
- response: |
    Think: The goal state requires moving box "a" one to the right one and down one. I will move the box "a" one to the right, then one down. To get to the immediate left of the box and move it right, I need to first move the robot up to avoid the wall.
