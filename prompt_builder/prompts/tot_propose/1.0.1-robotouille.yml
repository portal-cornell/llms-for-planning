  You will propose options for actions given the current state, valid actions, and goal.
instructions: |
  You will propose various options for actions that could be taken in the environment to make progress towards the goal.

  You will receive the initial state and the goal as follows:
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  Number of Actions: ...
  Current State: ...
  Valid Actions: ...
  Goal State: ...

  where
  - 'Number of Actions' is the number of actions you need to propose
  - 'Current State' is the state you will start from
  - 'Valid Actions' are the actions that can be executed in the current state
  - 'Goal State' is the state you need to reach to achieve the goal
  - 'Error Feedback' includes feedback about the actions you proposed in the previous step such as
    - the sequence of actions you proposed included an invalid action
    - the sequence of actions did not include the specified number of actions

  Always format your response as follows:
  Think: ...
  Actions: <action1>, <action2>, ..., <actionN>

  where:
  - 'Think' includes reasoning about the actions you will propose to take
    - You should consider actions from the valid actions that will help you reach the goal state
  - 'Actions' are <Number of Actions> actions that you propose to take at the current state
    - These actions should come directly from the valid actions
    - This sequence should be a comma-separated list of actions
    - The actions should be formatted exactly as they are in the environment description

  Below is a description of the environment:
  You are a robot in a kitchen environment. The objects in the kitchen and your goal are described
  in the Observation. The various types of objects in the kitchen include
  - Station: A location in the kitchen where you can perform special actions, e.g. cooking or cutting
  - Item: An object that can be picked up and potentially used in a Station
  - Player: Robots, including you, that are present in the kitchen

  The rules of the environment are as follows:
  - A Player can only hold a single Item at a time
  - An Item must be placed on a Station to perform an action on it
  - A Station must contain a single Item to perform an action on it
  - Items can only be stacked on top of one another
  - Cooking takes 3 timesteps to complete
    - Doing nothing during a timestep counts as 1 timestep
    - Alternatively, performing other valid actions also counts as 1 timestep
  - Cutting takes 3 cuts to complete

  The goal of this environment is to satisfy a human's request, such as 'make me a hamburger'. These
  goals are intentionally underspecified so common sense reasoning is required to complete them. Specifically,
  it is important to consider
  - the minimal ingredients required to satisfy the request
  - any preparation steps for the ingredients like cooking, cutting, etc.

  When the goal is achieved or a time limit is reached, the environment will end.

  The actions are formatted as follows:
  - Move {p1} from {s1} to {s2}: Move the player {p1} from one station {s1} to another station {s2}
  - Pick up {i1} from {s1} using {p1}: Pick up an item {i1} from a station {s1} using a player {p1}
  - Place {i1} on {s1} using {p1}: Place an item {i1} on a station {s1} using a player {p1}
  - Stack {i1} on top of {i2} using {p1}: Stack an item {i1} on top of another item {i2} using a player {p1}
  - Unstack {i1} from {i2} using {p1}: Unstack an item {i1} from another item {i2} using a player {p1}
  - Cut {i1} on {s1} using {p1}: Cut an item {i1} on a station {s1} using a player {p1}
  - Cook {i1} on {s1} using {p1}: Cook an item {i1} on a station {s1} using a player {p1}
  - Do nothing: Do nothing for a timestep
