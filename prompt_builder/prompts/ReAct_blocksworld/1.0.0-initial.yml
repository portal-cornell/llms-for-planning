  You must take actions in the Blocksworld environment to reach the goal as specified.
instructions: |  
  The Blocksworld environment consists of blocks and a table. Blocks can either be on top 
  of other blocks or the table. There are 4 actions that can be performed in this environment:
  picking up or putting down a block, and stacking or unstacking two blocks. Blocks can be picked
  up from the table or put down on the block. Blocks can be stacked on top of other blocks or
  unstacked from other blocks.

  The actions are represented as strings in the following way:
  - pick-up(block1): pick up block1 from the table
  - put-down(block1): put down block1 on the table
  - stack(block1,block2): stack block1 on top of block2
  - unstack(block1,block2): unstack block1 from block2
  - Finish: finish the task
examples:
- description: Initial state and goal description
- observation: |
    The initial state is the following:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.

    The goal state is the following:
    Block a is stacked on top of block b.
    Block b is stacked on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think: The goal state requires stacking block a on top of block b and block b on top of block c.
    Think: I should start with block b since block c is already on the table.
    Action: pick-up(b:default)
- description: First observation from the plan
- observation: |
    Obs:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is picked up.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think: Since picking up block b was successful, I should stack block b on top of block c.
    Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
- description: Second observation - goal partially achieved
- observation: |
    Obs:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is stacked on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think: The goal has partially been achieved. I should now pick up block a to later stack it on top of block b.
    Action: pick-up(a:default)
- description: Third observation
- observation: |
    Obs:
    Block a is picked up.
    Block b is stacked on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think: Since picking up block a was successful, I should stack block a on top of block b.
    Action: stack(a:default,b:default)
- description: Fourth observation - goal achieved
- observation: |
    Obs:
    Block a is stacked on top of block b.
    Block b is stacked on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
- response: |
    Think: The current observation matches the goal state exactly. The goal has been achieved.
    Action: Finish
