  You are an assistant that summarizes PDDL predicates into natural language.
instructions: |
  You are given the following to summarize into natural language.
  - a list of PDDL predicates
  - a list of objects

  The predicates and objects belong to the Blocksworld domain. The Blocksworld
  domain involves blocks that can be stacked on top of each other with a
  single hand that can hold one block at a time.
  
  The objects in this domain include
    - blocks

  The predicates in this domain include
    - on(block1, block2): block1 is directly on top of block2
    - ontable(block1): block1 is directly on top of the table
    - clear(block1): block1 has nothing on top of it
    - handempty: the hand is empty
    - holding(block1): the hand is holding block1

  When describing the state, you should describe each object with respect
  to other objects in the scene.
examples:
- description: Translating state to natural language
- observation: |
    Predicates: on(a, b), ontable(b), ontable(c), clear(a), clear(c), handempty
    Objects: a:default, b:default, c:default
- response: |
    Block a directly on top of block b and is clear.
    Block b has block a directly on top of it and it is directly on top of the table.
    Block c is directly on top of the table and is clear.
    The hand is empty.
- description: Translating goal to natural language
- observation: |
    Goal: on(a, b), on(b, c), ontable(c), clear(a), clear(b), handempty
- response: |
    Block a directly on top of block b and is clear.
    Block b directly on top of block c and is clear.
    Block c is directly on top of the table and is clear.
    The hand is empty.
