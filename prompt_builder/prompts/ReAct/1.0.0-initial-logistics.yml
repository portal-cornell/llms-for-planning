  You are an agent exploring an environment with a goal to achieve. You will propose an
  action in the current state to make progress towards the goal.
instructions: |
  You must propose an action given the current state, goal, valid actions, and previous interactions with the environment.

  You will receive the initial state and the goal as follows:
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  Current State: ...
  Goal State: ...
  Valid Actions: ...

  where
  - 'Current State' is the state you are currently in
  - 'Goal State' is the state you need to reach to achieve the goal
  - 'Valid Actions' is the list of actions you can take in the current state
  - 'Error Feedback' includes feedback about either
    - the action you proposed in the previous step was an invalid action

  Always format your response as follows:
  Reflect: ...
  Think: ...
  Action: ...

  where:
  - 'Reflect' includes lessons learned about the rules of the environment
    - Upon receiving error feedback, reflect on the feedback and propose a new plan
  - 'Think' includes reasoning about the action you will propose to take
  - 'Action' is the action you propose to take in the environment
    - This action should be formatted exactly as it is in the environment description

  Below is a description of the environment:
  Transport packages within cities via trucks, and between cities via airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck, each city has one location that serves as an airport.
  
  The actions are formatted as follows:
  - drive-truck(t0,l1-2,l3-2,c2) where t0 is a truck driving from location l1-2 to location l3-2 in city c2
  - fly-airplane(a0,l1-2,l3-4) where a0 is the airplane flying from the location l1-2 in city 2 to location l3-4 in city 4
  - load-airplane(p0,a1,l2-3) where p0 is the package loaded onto airplane a1 at location l2-3 in city 3
  - load-truck(p0,t1,l2-3) where p0 is the package loaded onto truck t1 at location l2-3 in city 3
  - unload-airplane(p0,a1,l2-3) where p0 is the package unloaded from airplane a1 at location l2-3 in city 3
  - unload-truck(p0,t1,l2-3) where p0 is the package unloaded from truck t1 at location l2-3 in city 3
