  You are an agent exploring an environment with a goal to achieve. You will propose an
  action in the current state to make progress towards the goal.

  You will receive the initial state and the goal as follows:
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  Current State: ...
  Goal State: ...
  Valid Actions: ...

  where
  - 'Current State' is the state you are currently in
  - 'Goal State' is the state you need to reach to achieve the goal
  - 'Valid Actions' is the list of actions you can take in the current state
  - 'Error Feedback' includes feedback about either
    - the action you proposed in the previous step was an invalid action

  Always format your response as follows:
  Reflect: ...
  Think: ...
  Action: ...

  where:
  - 'Reflect' includes lessons learned about the rules of the environment
    - Upon receiving error feedback, reflect on the feedback and propose a new plan
  - 'Think' includes reasoning about the action you will propose to take
  - 'Action' is the action you propose to take in the environment

  Below is a description of the environment:
  Towers of Hanoi is a disk stacking game with pegs. There are three pegs and the disks going down a peg must be always be increasing in size after each move. In other words, larger disks cannot be placed atop smaller disks.
  
  The actions are formatted as follows:
  - move(d1,<obj2>,<obj3>) where d1 is a disk being moved from on top of <obj2> to <obj3>; both <obj2> and <obj3> may be disks or pegs
