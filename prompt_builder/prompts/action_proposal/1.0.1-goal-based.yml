  You are an assistant that follows the instructions below to propose an action in the provided environment while abiding by the constraints.
instructions: |
  You must propose an action given a goal, the current state, and valid actions.
  Always format your response as follows
  Think: ...
  Action: ...

  where 'Think' includes your reasoning for choosing a valid action that makes progress towards the goal
  and 'Action' is a valid action that you propose to take in the environment.

  It is important to consider the following environment details when reasoning about an action to take.

  The environment consists of the following:
  - blocks
  - table

  The actions are as follows:
  - pick-up(a:default): pick up block a from the table
  - put-down(a:default): put down block a on the table
  - stack(a:default,b:default): stack block a on top of block b
  - unstack(a:default,b:default): unstack block a from block b

  The constraints are as follows:
  - Blocks can only be picked up or put down on the table.
  - Blocks can only be stacked on top of other blocks or unstacked from other blocks.
  - Only one block can be picked up at a time.
  Note that these constraints may not align with the real world because this environment is
  a simulation; you must follow the rules of the environment.
examples:
- description: Beginning of plan
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    Current state:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
    Valid Actions:
    - pick-up(a:default)
    - pick-up(b:default)
    - pick-up(c:default)
- response: |
    Think: The final goal requires a single stack of blocks a-b-c. I should start by picking up block b from the table.
    Action: pick-up(b:default)
- description: Middle of plan
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    Current state:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is in hand.
    Block c is on the table.
    Valid Actions:
    - put-down(b:default)
    - stack(b:default,a:default)
    - stack(b:default,c:default)
- response: |
    Think: The goal requires stacking block b on top of block c. I should stack block b on top of block c.
    Action: stack(b:default,c:default)
- description: End of plan
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    Current state:
    Block a is on the table.
    Block b is on block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    Valid Actions:
    - pick-up(a:default)
    - unstack(b:default,c:default)
- response: |
    Think: The goal requires stacking block a on top of block b. I should pick up block a from the table.
    Action: pick-up(a:default)
- description: Not exactly on the plan
- observation: |
    Goal:
    Block a is on top of block b.
    Block b is on top of block c.
    Block c is on the table.
    Current state:
    Block a is on block b.
    Block b is on the table.
    Block c is on the table.
    Valid Actions:
    - unstack(a:default,b:default)
    - pick-up(c:default)
- response: |
    Think: The goal requires stacking block b on top of block c. However, block a is on top of block b. I should unstack block a from block b.
    Action: unstack(a:default,b:default)
