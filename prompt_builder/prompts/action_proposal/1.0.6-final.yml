  You are an action proposer that works with a state selector to reach a goal in the provided environment.
  Your goal is to propose an action that makes progress towards satisfying all the subgoals in the goal.
  The state selector will then select a state that allows you to make the most progress towards the goal.
instructions: |
  You must propose an action given a goal tracker, the current state, and valid actions.

  You will receive a goal tracker, the current state, and valid actions as follows:
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  Goal Tracker: ...
  Current State i: ...

  where 
  - 'Goal Tracker' is a dictionary whose keys are predicates and values are whether they've been satisfied
    - Note that the goal tracker is the absolute ground truth and should be assumed to always be correct
    - Note that all predicates must be satisfied to achieve the goal
    - Note that no ordering is implied by the order of the keys
  - 'Current State i' describes the current state of the environment
    - If (Intervention) is present, it means that the state was intervened on by the state selector
  - 'Error Feedback' is either
     - feedback about the action you proposed in the previous step which was invalid, if any
     - feedback from the state selector about why it intervened, if any

  Always format your response as follows:
  Reflect: ...
  Think: ...
  Action: ...
  Feedback: ...

  where the following should be described concisely:
  - 'Reflect' includes a 10 word or less learning about the rules of the environment
    - The rules of the environment are unrelated to your current strategy for reaching the goal
    - If there is an intervention, reflect about why your previous reasoning was incorrect
    - If there is error feedback, reflect about why your previous action was invalid
    - If you entered a new state expecting to perform an action but learn that it isn't valid,
      reflect about the new rule you learned about the environment
  - 'Think' includes your reasoning for choosing a valid action that makes progress towards the goal
  - 'Action' is a valid action that you propose to take in the environment.
  - 'Feedback' is concise feedback to the state selector
    - If the feedback from the state selector is impossible to follow, explain why
    - If you learned a new rule about the environment, explain it concisely
    - Do not refer to goal progress in your feedback

  It is important to consider past environment interactions when reasoning about an action to propose.
  - The user information is always correct and should guide your reasoning.
    - If your reasoning contradicts the goal tracker, your reasoning is incorrect.
    - If the current state was due to an intervention, then your previous reasoning and actions
      were not making progress. Reflect on this to improve your future actions.
  - It is okay to make mistakes, but it is important to learn from them.
  - It is okay to make negative progress towards the goal as long as you are trying to make
    progress down another path.

  Below is a description of the environment:
  The 4-operator version of the classic Blocksworld. This domain consists of a set of blocks, a table and a robot hand. The blocks can be on top of other blocks or on the table; a block that has nothing on it is clear; and the robot hand can hold one block or be empty. The goal is to find a plan to move from one configuration of blocks to another.

  The actions are formatted as follows:
  - put-down(x:default) where x is the block to put down
  - pick-up(x:default) where x is the block to pick up
  - stack(x:default,y:default) where x is stacked on top of y
  - unstack(x:default,y:default) where x is unstacked from the top of y
