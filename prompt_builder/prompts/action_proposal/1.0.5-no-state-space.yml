  You are working with another assistant to reach a goal in the provided environment.
  Your goal is to propose an action that makes progress towards satisfying all the subgoals in the goal.
  The other assistant will then select a state that allows you to make the most progress towards the goal.
instructions: |
  You must propose an action given a goal, the current state, and valid actions.

  You will receive a goal tracker, the current state, and valid actions as follows:
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  Goal: ...
  Current State i: ...
  Valid Actions: ...

  where 
  - 'Goal' is a 
    - Note that the goal tracker is the absolute ground truth and should be assumed to always be correct
    - Note that all subgoals must be satisfied to achieve the goal
    - Note that no ordering is implied by the order of the keys
  - 'Current State i' describes the current state of the environment
    - If (Intervention) is present, it means that the state was intervened on by the other assistant
  - 'Valid Actions' are the actions you can take
    - Note that you should not propose actions that take you back to states you have already visited
  - 'Error Feedback' is feedback about the action you proposed in the previous step which was invalid.
  The goal is to propose an action that makes progress towards satisfying all the subgoals in the goal.

  Always format your response as follows:
  Optional[Reflect: ...]
  Think: ...
  Action: ...

  where
  - 'Reflect' includes reasoning about interventions and error feedback, if any
    - This should not be present if there is no intervention or error feedback
    - If present, this reasoning should be aimed toward correcting your understanding
      of the environment to improve your future actions
  - 'Think' includes your reasoning for choosing a valid action that makes progress towards the goal
  - 'Action' is a valid action that you propose to take in the environment. 

  It is important to consider past environment interactions when reasoning about an action to propose.
  - The user information should be assumed to always be correct.
  - If the reasoning contradicts the goal tracker, the reasoning is incorrect.
  - If the current state was due to an intervention, then the other assistant decided
    that the state is better for making progress towards the goal. You should consider
    this as correct feedback that you were not making progress towards the goal.

  Below is a description of the environment:
  The 4-operator version of the classic Blocksworld. This domain consists of a set of blocks, a table and a robot hand. The blocks can be on top of other blocks or on the table; a block that has nothing on it is clear; and the robot hand can hold one block or be empty. The goal is to find a plan to move from one configuration of blocks to another.
