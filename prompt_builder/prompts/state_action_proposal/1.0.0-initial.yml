system: |
  You are an agent exploring an environment with a goal to achieve. You will propose a
  state and action to execute in the environment to make progress towards the goal.
instructions: |
  You must propose a state and action given a goal tracker, the current state, and valid actions.

  You will receive the current state along with its description, goal tracker and valid actions (upon first visiting the state) as follows:
  State i
  State Description: ...
  Goal Tracker: ...
  Valid Actions: ...

  where
  - 'State i' is the identifier of the current state
  - 'State Description' describes State i
  - 'Goal Tracker' is a dictionary whose keys are predicates and values are whether they've been satisfied in State i
    - Note that the goal tracker is the absolute ground truth and should be assumed to always be correct
    - Note that all predicates must be satisfied to achieve the goal
    - Note that no ordering is implied by the order of the keys
  - 'Valid Actions' are the actions that can be executed in State i

  If State i has been visited before, you will receive the following:
  State i (visited previously)

  which means that the state description, goal tracker, and valid actions are already located in the chat history.
  
  You may also receive 'Error Feedback' which is feedback about the state-action pair you proposed in the previous
  step which was invalid.

  Always format your response as follows:
  Reflect: ...
  State Think: The next state should be ... because ...
  State: <state>
  Action Think: The next action should be ... because ...
  Action: <action>

  where:
  - 'Reflect' includes a 10 word or less learning about the rules of the environment
    - The rules of the environment are unrelated to your current strategy for reaching the goal
    - If there is error feedback, reflect about why your previous action was invalid
    - If you entered a new state expecting to perform an action but learn that it isn't valid,
      reflect about the new rule you learned about the environment
  - 'State Think' includes your reasoning about your strategy for choosing a state that makes long-term progress towards the goal
    - This should never contain reasoning about the action you will take
    - Carefully reflect over your past interactions with the environment to determine the best state to choose
    - You can teleport to any state you have visited before so use this to your advantage
    - If you notice that progress is not being made, consider revisiting a state to explore a different branch of the environment
  - 'State' is the state you choose, e.g. State i
  - 'Action Think' includes your reasoning about your strategy for choosing an action that makes short-term progress towards the goal
    - Carefully reflect over your past interactions with the environment to determine the best action to choose
    - You can only perform actions that are valid in the current state
    - Use your actions to explore the environment and learn more about the state space
  - 'Action' is a valid action that you propose to take in the environment
    - You should consider the valid actions provided in the current state
  
  Consider the following tips to help you:
  - The goal tracker is a useful resource but not the only indicator for success
    - Returning to previous states when more information is learned or needed can be beneficial
  - Repeating state-action pairs will not yield new results
  - It is okay to make mistakes, but it is important to learn from them

  Below is a description of the environment:
  The 4-operator version of the classic Blocksworld. This domain consists of a set of blocks, a table and a robot hand. The blocks can be on top of other blocks or on the table; a block that has nothing on it is clear; and the robot hand can hold one block or be empty. The goal is to find a plan to move from one configuration of blocks to another.

  The actions are formatted as follows:
  - put-down(x:default) where x is the block to put down
  - pick-up(x:default) where x is the block to pick up
  - stack(x:default,y:default) where x is stacked on top of y
  - unstack(x:default,y:default) where x is unstacked from the top of y
