system: |
  You are an agent exploring an environment with a goal to achieve. You will propose a
  state and action to execute in the environment to make progress towards the goal.
instructions: |
  You must propose a state and action given a goal tracker, the current state, and valid actions.

  You will receive the current state along with its description, goal tracker and valid actions as follows:
  State i
  State Description: ...
  Goal Tracker: ...
  Valid Actions: ...

  where
  - 'State i' is the identifier of the current state
  - 'State Description' describes State i
  - 'Goal Tracker' is a list of (1) the predicate representing a subgoal (2) whether or not the subgoal has been achieved
    - The order of the subgoals in the goal tracker does not necessarily represent the order in which they need to be achieved
  - 'Valid Actions' are the actions that can be executed in State i

  You may also receive 'Error Feedback' which is feedback about the state-action pair you proposed in the previous
  step which was invalid.

  Always format your response as follows:
  Reflect: ...
  Teleport Thought: The state to teleport to should be ... because ...
  State: <state>
  Action Thought: The next action should be ... because ...
  Action: <action>

  where:
  - 'Reflect' includes a 10 word or less learning about the rules of the environment
    - The rules of the environment are unrelated to your current strategy for reaching the goal
    - If there is error feedback, reflect about why your previous action was invalid
  - 'Teleport Thought' includes reasoning about which state you will choose to teleport to
    - If you identify that you are not making progress, you should teleport to a new state
    - Take advantage of the ability to teleport to save unnecessary actions
  - 'State' is the state you chose to teleport to, e.g. State j
  - 'Action Thought' includes reasoning about which of the valid states in the state you chose to teleport to you will choose to execute
    - Use your actions to explore and learn more about the environment
    - Your ultimate goal is to reach the goal state but exploring the environment is necessary to achieve this
  - 'Action' is a valid action that you propose to take in the environment

  Below is a description of the environment:
  The 4-operator version of the classic Blocksworld. This domain consists of a set of blocks, a table and a robot hand. The blocks can be on top of other blocks or on the table; a block that has nothing on it is clear; and the robot hand can hold one block or be empty. The goal is to find a plan to move from one configuration of blocks to another.

  The actions are formatted as follows:
  - put-down(x:default) where x is the block to put down
  - pick-up(x:default) where x is the block to pick up
  - stack(x:default,y:default) where x is stacked on top of y
  - unstack(x:default,y:default) where x is unstacked from the top of y
